            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ Vnto the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>THERE was written (gentle Reader) manie yeares agoe, a ſhort declaration of the right and onely lawfull Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which our Sauior Christ hath ordayned for the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Church. Which declaration being not publiſhed at the time it was prepared for, hath come ſince into the handes of ſome, who conſidering the Treatiſe to be modestlie and learnedlie writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and diſcerning a fitte time and occaſion for the purpoſe, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it in the yeare 84. to be printed. Since which time it hath bin read and conſidered of by many, but, either becauſe the trueth of it ſeemed cleare, or becauſe the doctrine conteyned in it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, without particuler application to the ſtate of our Church, or for ſome other like reſpect (as I ſuppoſe) it hath had quiet and free paſſage hitherto, without anie replication made vnto it.</p>
            <p>Nowe commeth out one after ſo many yeares, belike hauing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughlie in all the time ſtudied the matter: who replieth to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and vndertaketh to ſhewe that there is no ſuch Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline appointed by our Sauior Christ, as is there declared to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned by his authoritie. This Treatiſe the Author calleth, <hi>A defence of the gouernement eſtabliſhed in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande for eccleſiaſticall matters.</hi> Which tytle, whether he were mooued to giue his booke as most plauſible, or as most profitable: hoping peraduenture for no ſmall recompence of ſuch a ſeruice as he taketh vpon him to performe, or what other reaſon ſoeuer it were, becauſe I could not diſcerne anie ſufficient reaſon for it, (the booke he would confute, declaring onely a generall doctrine for all Churches, and dealing litle more with this Church, then anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much leſſe impugning it, that it ſhould neede his defence) I haue thought good, rather to call his booke, A replie to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, as it is in deede, and as the nature of the writing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19103:3"/> he ſhould haue called it, then to keepe the name whiche hee hath giuen it. The declaration he hath diuided into manie ſmall pieces and ſections, and ſo ſetteth it downe all before him: wherin he ſeemeth to vndertake to proue, that there is not a worde in that godlie learned Treatiſe, which hee will not ſhewe to be reprouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: which howe he performeth, and what honor he is to carie out of this fielde, wherein he is entred with great triumphe, I leaue to the Christian Reader by this anſwere to conſider.</p>
            <p>His first ſection (becauſe nothing ſhould eſcape him) is vppon theſe wordes ſet after the preface and before the first ſentence of the booke, &amp; vpon the toppe of euerie leafe, <hi>A learned diſcourſe of eccleſiaſticall gouernement.</hi> This Title both here and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the Replie is much iested at and played withall. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere wherevnto, the Reader is to vnderstande, the right title of the booke ſet downe in the first page thereof, is, A briefe &amp; plain declaration, &amp;c. The other is of like the Printers, or ſome others to whoſe hande the copie might come, a thing vſuallie done, and without anie iust note of ostentation in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who is ſeldome or neuer priuie to ſuch addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But let vs leaue the Title, and paſſe on to the Booke.</p>

            <head type="sub">Againſt a Replie of Maiſter <hi>Bridges,</hi> to a briefe and plaine Declaration of it, whiche was printed, An<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1584. &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Writer of the Declaration, purpoſing to ſhewe by the holy Scriptures, what Diſcipline and order for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Church, Almightie GOD, who is onely wiſe, hath appointed, thought meete to laye firſt ſuch a foundation of all his Worke, as being ſure and immoueable, might be able to beare that he ſhould buylde vpon it.</p>
            <p>This foundation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of theſe three ſentences, the firſt, That the Church is the houſe of God: The ſeconde riſinge of the former, that therefore it ought to be directed in all things according to the order which God the houſholder hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: The thirde, That the order preſcribed by God for the guyding of the ſame, is not to bee learned elſewhere but in Gods moſt holy worde. For proofe of all theſe, it is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atlie adioyned, that the firſt is conteyned in the firſt Epiſtle to Tim. cap. 3. The ſeconde neceſſarilie followeth of the firſte.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> The thirde is proued by the 2. Epiſt. Tim. 3.16.17.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.17</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the foundation which the Writer thought good to lay of all his Treatiſe, to the ende, that what ſoeuer he ſhould after ſhewe out of the worde of God, to be appointed by him for the good direction and guydance of his Church, might be receyued of the Church of God, as the ordinance of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, wherevnto all the houſholde ought to be obedient.</p>
            <p>The Replyer in like maner, knowing that if he could ſhake the foundation, the reſt of the buylding muſt needes fall downe: beginneth to proue his ſtrength in ſhakinge of this grounde-worke, whiche ſtanding vppon three ſentences (as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19103:4"/> hath bin ſhewed) he beginneth with viewing of the firſte of theſe, which being ſtrong and immoueable, he paſſeth by it, and leaueth it as ſure as he founde it, confeſſing it to be trewe in deede, that the Church is the houſe of the liuing God, and ſaying for him ſelfe, and ſuch as he dealeth for, we moſt glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie admitte this, as the very worde of the holy Ghoſt. This being graunted, the next point were nowe to bee conſidered, but that I thinke it needefull the Reader be admoniſhed of a point or two ſett downe by the Replier in his anſwere to this firſt ſentence vpon occaſion of the Text alleadged to proue that the Church is the houſe of God, he addeth theſe wordes following in the ſame place, that the Church is the pillar and grounde of trueth, which is ſo (ſayeth he) in this matter of Eccleſiaſticall gouernement, and in all other, ſo farre as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation. Wherevpon he gathereth, that either the Diſcipline declared in the booke which he laboureth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, is not neceſſarie, or elſe, that the Church, at leaſt in ſome ages and places, as a pillar of trueth, hath vpholden and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned it, or ſtriuen for it: which he alleadgeth impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie altogither to the eſpeciall matter he was to intreate of, yet agreeing with his generall purpoſe to laye in all places ſome ſtone of offence, which may hinder the Reader to receyue the right and onely lawfull Diſcipline of the Church, in ſuch ſort as by the word of God appertayneth. In the former point whereof, it is to be obſerued, that the Replyer graunteth, the matter of Eccleſiaſticall gouernement, in ſome part thereof, as well as other matters of doctrine, to be neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is worthie to bee obſerued here, becauſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impugners of the holy Diſcipline and order appointed of God for the guydance of his Church, make it no matter of ſuch importance: wherevpon it muſt needes followe by his owne rule, that the Church at leaſt in ſuch pointes of it hath kept and ought to mainteyne the trew and right Diſcipline of the Church. Furthermore, for clearing of another point which he implyeth by his wordes, that is, that there is ſome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19103:4"/> trueth of God in matters of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, and in other pointes of doctrine, which are not neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore not mainteyned by the Church: it is to be vnderſtoode, that in ſome ſenſe of neceſſarie, &amp; in their place and degree, all trueth both in the matter of Eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and alſo in all other Articles of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is neceſſarie to ſaluation. True it is that ſome pointes are ſo neceſſarie, as that in the ordinarie diſpenſation of God, no man can be ſaued without ſuch meanes: of whiche ſorte alſo there are ſome, euen in the Diſcipline of the Church, as is the miniſterie of the Goſpell, by ſuch as are ſent of GOD therevnto, and ſuch like. There are othet whiche are not ſo ſimplie, abſolutelie, and immediatlie neceſſarie, but yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie as meanes ordayned of God for the better furtherance of our ſaluation, both in their owne vſe, and in the helpe they yeelde to make the other degree of meanes more fitte to doe vs good, and more ſeruiceable and effectuall, when they are duely prepared therevnto. For example hereof, to beleeue the promiſes of the Goſpell, in the ordinarie diſpenſation of God, is ſimplie, and abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no faith of it, except it be declared to men, by ſuch as are ſent of God for that purpoſe, this meanes is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo alike neceſſarie. Now for the better furthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of mens ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereby, God hath apointed, that there ſhould be Paſtors of it and Doctors in the Church for the ordinarie work of the miniſterie of the Goſpell. He hath alſo declared howe ſuche Preachers ought to be qualified, and in what manner they are to preache. He hath appointed alſo his holy Sacramentes to be adminiſtred, cenſures and corrections of offences to bee vſed, with many other ſuch like ordinances. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they be not all neceſſarie in the ſame degree that the former meanes are: yet are they neceſſarie to prepare the ſame that they may be the fitter to doe vs good. So the preachinge of the Goſpell is the fitter to profite vs, when it is preached, as by the orders appointed of God it ought to be, that is, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

And becauſe God giueth not ſuch men to his Church extraordinarilie, the meanes whereby God hath prouided for the furniſhing of the Church with ſuch, as their due ordination, election, examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch like, are in their degree alſo neceſſarie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it were to be wiſhed, that wee had not ſo euident and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine proofe as we haue, in the daunger of ſo many amongeſt vs, as are hazarded, for want of ſufficient Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the neceſſarie meanes, by the ordinance of GOD, to haue ſuch as may be worthie to beare the name of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his people. The ſame may be ſaide of the due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the cenſures of the Church: Whiche, howe neceſſarie it is in his place &amp; degree, for the bringing of the obſtinate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the knowledge of his faulte, and to repentance, &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by faith for pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt Ieſus to ſaluation: I thinke, by former examples, and daily experience of ſuch as haue bin recouered by that meanes, and of other that haue died in their ſinnes, for want of the ſame, may eaſilie be diſcerned. Beſides theſe reſpectes, they are alſo neceſſarie, in regarde of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ordinance and appointement, the contemptuous breache of whoſe commaundementes, be they great or little in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is damnable to all thoſe that doe deſpiſe them. Thus much may ſuffiſe to cleare theſe wordes of the Replyer, ſo farre as is neceſſarie to ſaluation. Vpon this gloſe he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the Diſcipline declared in the booke he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, eyther is not neceſſarie, or elſe, at leaſt in ſome ages and places, hath bin mainteyned and kept, or ſtriuen for to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed. I anſwere, that in ſuch ſenſe of neceſſarie as I haue mentioned it ſo to be, the Diſcipline, ſett downe in the declaration, is neceſſarie to ſaluation: and further, that it hath bin mainteyned in ſundrie times and places, and is at this day exerciſed and laboured for in the middeſt of the Church.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:19103:5"/>
            <p>In the Apoſtles times, and thoſe which followed next after them, it was exerciſed and mainteyned in all the places where the Apoſtles ſettled &amp; eſtabliſhed any Churches, as appeareth by their owne exerciſes and the ſtorie of their Actes, as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in the Declaration, and ſundrie other bookes of like argument. After that time it began in deede to decline in ſome partes, as did other pointes of the Goſpell. But notable euidences are to be ſhewed, of ſundrie partes thereof, in the writings of the auncient Fathers, exerciſing ſome partes of it, and lamenting the decay of ſome other. In this age it is not vnknowen to be receyued, mainteyned &amp; exerciſed in all the Churches of France, of the lowe Countries, and of Scotland, for many yeares togither. In this Church it hath bin laboured for, nowe many yeares, of the Miniſterie, by writing, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and by petitions offred to the Conuocation houſe, of ſome of the commons in Parliament: nowe three ſundrie times, by ſuch meanes, as to that high Court appertayneth, &amp; by manie of all degrees and callings, by moſt humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to almightie God, and all authoritie whiche he hath ſett ouer vs, and by ſundrie other chriſtian dueties, and is not to be giuen ouer, till God may heare vs, and the righteouſnes of Syon may come forth as the light of the day, and hir ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhine like a burning lampe: and till the lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſet ouer vs, may attende our pleas in Gods behalue, and giue ſentence with vs. Nowe followeth the ſecond propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or principle ſet downe in the Declaration, and affirmed by the ſame to riſe from the former: the Replyer agreeth that it doeth ſo, and that this rule is alſo true: but in ſuch ſenſe as he maketh of it, and not in the ſenſe of the Declaration. The ſenſe he maketh of theſe wordes, <hi>is,</hi> that in all things that God hath preſcribed, the Church is to be directed by his order, but denieth all things belonging to the externall regiment of the Church, to be appointed by him, which the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taketh neceſſarilie to followe of the former ſentence. This is the effect of his replie to this point. But becauſe hee had eyther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19103:6"/> read it in ſome booke written of the Diſcipline of the church, or thought of him ſelfe, the place might be alleadged for ſuch purpoſe, though it be not mencioned here, hee laboureth to ſhewe that the verſe of the 9. Chapter to the Hebrew. proueth not, that our Sauiour Chriſt hath appointed, a certayne and neceſſarie order for the outwarde direction of the Church, in all Eccleſiaſticall matters, which he ſheweth in this maner.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle (ſayeth he) referreth not this of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the Church, applying it after in the 9. chap. much leſſe to the externall regiment in all Eccleſiaſticall matters, no not before in the 3. where yet he ſpeaketh of Chriſte and of his Church, but teacheth vs, that in the inwarde and ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the Church, wee are to acknowledge Chriſte the Lorde, the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion, and to confirme our faith in him, if we holde faſt (not this or that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall order of eccleſiaſticall gouernement) but the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and reioyſing of hope vnto the ende. Thus paſſeth hee ouer this ſecond point: wherin it is to be obſerued, that he con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmeth not his owne opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is, that our Sauior Chriſt hath not ſet downe anie certaine rule for the direction of the Church in all Eccleſiaſticall matters: neither aunſwereth the reaſons that are by diuers alleadged to this purpoſe: but only laboureth to ſhewe that the 8. of the Hebr. 5. verſe, doeth not proue it. Which howe he hath performed may be conſidered by this which followeth. In exodus chap. 25. ver. 40. whence the wordes alleadged out of the Epiſt. to the Hebr. are taken after a particular rehearſall of the charge giuen to Moſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the making of the Tabernacle, &amp; the furniture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Arke of couenant, the Table, the Candleſtickes, with the Inſtrumentes neceſſarie for it, and with ſpeciall direction both for the matter, fourme and meaſure of the ſame: in the ende of all, the charge giuen him, is generallie rehearſed in theſe wordes, <hi>See that thou make them according to the faſhion &amp; paterne of the things which was ſhewed thee to ſee in the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.</hi> In like maner in the next Chapter, after a particular
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19103:6"/> rehearſall of the thinges that belonged to the Tabernacle. Towarde the ende of the Chapter, it is ſaide, <hi>So ſet thou vp the Tabernacle, according to the likenes of that whiche was ſhewed thee to be ſeene in the mountayne.</hi> Whereby it is manifeſt, that the charge giuen to Moſes, was of making the thinges of the externall and outwarde Tabernacle, whiche were in deede fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures (as the Apoſtle ſayeth) of better, euen of heauenly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: (noted by the ſhewing of the ſame in the mountayne,) but the charge giuen to Moſes, was concerning the outwarde Tabernacle, and externall order for making the ſame. Which appeareth alſo by the 39. chap. of the ſame booke, where it is written, <hi>That all theſe thinges were made, accordinge to all the charge, that God had giuen to Moſes.</hi> In whiche reſpect the faithfulnes of Moſes is commended by the Apoſtle in the 3. chapter to the Hebr. becauſe he had performed all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the charge he had receyued. Nowe the Apoſtle ſetting out the dignitie and honour of our Sauiour Chriſt, by preferring him before Moſes, in the adminiſtration and gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church: declareth, Moſes in deede to haue bin faithfull in all the houſe of God, but yet as a ſeruant in the houſe: whereas our Sauiour Chriſte, was not as a ſeruaunt in the houſe, but as the Sonne and heire, gouerning and rulinge ouer his owne houſe. Foraſmuch then as euery one is more faithfull, diligent, and carefull of that which is his owne, then anie that dealeth with that which is anothers: it muſt needes be, that our Sauiour Chriſt hath ſhewed him ſelfe more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then Moſes, who was but a ſeruant in his houſe, he being the ſonne and heire, gouerning ouer his owne houſe. But if the faithfulnes of Moſes appeared in all the houſe of GOD, that is, in all that belonged to the adminiſtration of it in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reſpect for that time, to a ſufficient direction, euen in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and externall regiment, in all Eccleſiaſticall matters, as well ſmall as great: it muſt needes followe, that he who hath performed incomparablie greater faithfulnes to the Church, hath as farre, as was neceſſarie for it, left certayne and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19103:7"/> direction, euen for the outwarde adminiſtration of it in all like matters. But the Replyer ſeemeth to affirme, that no certaine externall forme of eccleſiaſticall gouernement is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, in that he noteth vpon the 3. to the Hebr. thus: <hi>Wee are his houſe or Church, if we holde faste (not this or that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall forme of gouernement) but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence and reioyſing of hope vnto the ende.</hi> Wherein, hee conſidereth not, that a certaine outwarde order is neceſſarie, for the keeping and holding faſt of that confidence and reioyſing of hope vnto the ende. For the adminiſtration both of the Worde and of the Sacraments is outward, aſwell as is the order. For the calling of ſuche as are to beare anie charge in the Church, or the order for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſame, this being a parte of the Paſtors duetie, no leſſe, nay more publique, open, and outward, then ſundrie other dueties are which-belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to his Miniſterie. But, a certaine order for the adminiſtration of the worde, and of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, was neceſſarie to be left to the Church by our Sauior Chriſt. For, Apoſtles and Prophetes, Paſtors and Doctors, are ſet in the Church, for the worke of the Miniſterie, till all the faithfull attayne to the vnitie of the faith, and knowledge of the Sonne of God. Which being neceſſarie to ſaluation, the meanes in that the ordinarie diſpenſation of God, are abſolu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>telie neceſſarie thervnto, muſt needs be in like maner by him appointed. <hi>Zuencfeldius</hi> in deede, and ſome of the Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, make ſmall account of the preaching of the worde, or of the Miniſterie of the Sacramentes, as beeing outwarde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, fitter for children in their opinions then for men of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, imagining ſuch a perfection in themſelues, by immediate reuelations from God, as needeth not anie ſuche helpes of outwarde meanes. But they which diſcerne of this vngodly preſumption and vanitie, muſt needes confeſſe, the Miniſterie of the worde and Sacramentes, to be neceſſarie for them:<note place="margin">Mat. 7.6. Mat. 16. Actes 1.8.</note> and that therefore, it was needefull, the Lorde ſhould leaue a certaine order for the directing of his Church in that adminiſtration and miniſterie. Which alſo, becauſe it was ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19103:7"/> needefull, the holy Scriptures declare him to haue done.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> For, touching the worde, what ſhould bee preached, and by whom, and vnto whom, with all other neceſſarie circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euen in outwarde things, he gaue certaine order vnto his Diſciples.

                  </gap>.</note> and at his aſcenſion into heauen, he inſtructed them in what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde maner, they were to adminiſter it, and vnto what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Of the Lords ſupper, the Apoſtle ſayeth, That whiche I receyued of the Lorde, I haue deliuered vnto you, plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that the Lorde had deliuered vnto him a certayne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the outwarde adminiſtration of his Supper. Theſe things and the like which might be ſaide of the other pointes of the outwarde Diſcipline of the Church, the Replyer againſt it, did not well conſider, in making no externall forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement neceſſarie, but perſeuerance in fayth and hope. Nay it may ſeeme, hee did not well remember, that in other places the neceſſitie of continuing the preſent gouernement of BB. and Archbiſhops, Prieſtes and Deacons, ſuch as wee haue amongſt vs, is affirmed to haue ground and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance from the very Apoſtles: who alſo are ſayde to haue made Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus ſuch. For which cauſe alſo, at the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euerie of them, certayne places of the Scripture are appointed to be read, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyning their Inſtitution and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Church. But howe truelie and faithfullie ſuch places are alleadged for that purpoſe, there are but fewe, but vpon the reading of thoſe textes of Scripture, may diſcerne. Yet howſoeuer they fayle in their proofe that ſeeke the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Hierarchie, ſo commonly called: this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by their owne allegations, that ſometimes, and in parte, they would perſwade men that there is an externall forme of adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church appointed by our Sauior Chriſt. Which, would to God they did, not onely ſometimes, and in parte, but alwayes and altogither, perſwade them ſelues and others, as the trueth is in deede, that God hath ſet downe in his holy worde, a certayne forme of gouerning the Church of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19103:8"/> Chriſt, neceſſarie and perpetuall, by particular directions in all the chiefe and principall pointes, and by generall rules for time, place, and ſuch like circumſtances: and that they would rather labour with vs to ſhewe what the ſame is by the worde of God, then to ſtriue for the contrarie, that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme at all. The proofe of this point that there is a certayne and perpetuall order ſet downe in the word of God for the guyding of the Church in eccleſiaſticall matters, hath bin often made, by diuers who haue trauayled in this cauſe, as appeareth in their bookes. But becauſe the Replyer deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to haue bene proued, yet it ſhall not bee amiſſe to laye downe brieflie ſuch reaſons in this place, as may ſerue for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of the world, there hath bin ordayned of God a certayne externall forme for directing the Church. ſuch, as ſeemed good to his heauenlie wiſedome, and agreed beſt with that time for which it ſerued, both before, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lawe, euen from Adam to Chriſt. Whiche, for ſuche time was not to be altered by anie liuing creature. Therefore there is alſo ſome certayne forme of adminiſtring the church of God, from the time of our Sauiour Chriſte, to the ende of the worlde, which is not alterable nor to be chaunged by anie power of man. For, God being as able and as willing to doe this good vnto his Church in theſe laſt dayes, as in anie time before, and there being no ſufficient reaſon to be rendred of ſuch difference, why thoſe times ſhould be ſo regarded, and this not: it muſt needes be, that there is a certayne forme ſett downe in the worde of God, for the outwarde adminiſtration of the Church. Againe, the externall adminiſtration of the church vnder the Law was ſuch as had proceeded from God, and was not altered nor to be altered by any King or Prieſt whatſoeuer. For the firſt plat was giuen in the mount, what alteration after was made by Dauid or others, was not of them ſelues,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 8. and 25.26. 2. Chr. 29.25</note> but by ſpeciall and particular direction of God by the Prophetes. Therefore if no iuſt reaſon of difference be to bee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19103:8"/> ſhewed to the contrarie, (as there is not) it muſt be confeſſed, that God hath ordayned a certayne externall forme of gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement for the Church in this time, and not left it to the arbitrarie, direction and lawes of any men whatſoeuer. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where there is a Miniſterie and diſpenſation of holy things ordayned, there muſt needes bee an order ſett downe for the deliuering and diſpoſinge of them. Otherwiſe they muſt of neceſſitie be expoſed to certayne prophanation: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch ordinances accompanie ſuch adminiſtrations, and haue both their beginning and ending with them. So in the Lawe, the Prieſthoode being appointed for the miniſterie of things that were holy: there was withall a lawe of ordinances giuen for certayne direction of their office, whiche lawe alſo ceaſed, and was aboliſhed when the Prieſthoode was tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taken away from the houſe of <hi>Leui,</hi> as wee are taught in the example of the Hebrewes. In like maner,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.12.</note> ſeeing that in the Church of Chriſt, ſince the abrogatinge of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode of the Lawe, there is inſtituted a miniſterie of holy things, and officers for the purpoſe, it muſt needes bee, that there is alſo a certaine order ſet down for the guiding of them in the execution of their Miniſterie. Which is the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, conſiſting onely in the execution of ſuch dueties, as they are to performe, which are called to beare any charge in the Church of God: as the regiment of euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth ſtandeth in the offices and dueties of the Magiſtrates, &amp; thoſe that haue authoritie in it. Moreouer, the Names of Chriſt and his Church, the peace, order, edification, and perpetuitie of the church doe proue that there is a certain externall forme of adminiſtring it. For if Chriſt be a King, a High Prieſt, an Houſholder, and the Church his Kingdome, his Temple and his Houſe: then muſt it needes be, that he hath giuen, though ſpirituall in regarde of the ende they haue, as his kingdome is ſpirituall: yet ſome certayne externall meanes, conſtitutions and orders, for the good gouerning and guyding of the ſame. For this is incident to euery wyſe man of authoritie, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19103:9"/> when he him ſelfe ſhall not perſonallie remayne amongſt thoſe that belong vnto him. And ſo our Sauiour noteth his purpoſe to doe,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. Luke 19.12. Lu. 12.42.43</note> in the parable of the Talentes, deliuered to diuers ſeruantes, and of the Steward left with charge of the houſe till his comming. The ſame is to be ſaid of the church, which is the Lords kingdome, temple, and houſe: this being a matter agreeing to euery ſocietie, eſpeciallie hauing a wyſe gouernour, and the ſocietie being ſuch as may haue nothing done confuſedlie, diſorderly, and offenſiuelie in it, but all, with peace, order, and to edification, and whiche is to abide &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for euer. But ſuch a ſocietie the Church is. For ſome ſhort time, it maybe ſome ſmall ſocietie may continue in tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable maner, without certaine preſcripte lawes to gouerne it, yet hardlie can it long ſo continue, without ſundrie ſuche diſorders, as in the ende muſt needes ouerthrowe it. But a common wealth and a kingdome, and that ſuch a one as is ſpreade ouer all the worlde, and to continue to the ende of the ſame, to be like an Inne of Court, without written lawes, and orders for the gouernement of it for euer, can not ſtande with the wiſedome of God, with the offices of our Sauiour Chriſt, with the nature of the Church, nor with the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, peace, order, and perpetuitie of the ſame. Further, the whole exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall forme of th'adminiſtration of the Church conſiſteth in the kindes and charges of offices, vpon whoſe care and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the church in ſuch matters is to depende, &amp; in the things which concerne their lawfull vocation to ſuch places, &amp; due execution of that belongeth vnto them: but all theſe pointes are particularly ſet downe in the worde of God in the ſeueral charges of Miniſters of the worde, of Elders, of Deacons, and of the ioint care of Elderſhippes and Synodes, as is to appeare in the proofe of euery ſeuerall part hereafter: therefore it is to be acknowledged, that ſuch an externall forme of Diſcipline and direction of the Church, is appointed of God. Beſides all this, the things which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the kingdome of Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſuch an external forme is not the leaſt, the Euangeliſt Luke
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19103:9"/> writeth, that full fortie dayes, the Diſciples were inſtructed by our Sauiour after his reſurrection,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.23 1. Cor. 14.37 Mat. 28.20.

For which reſpect in diuers places of the newe Teſtament, ſundrie principall partes of the Diſcipline and externall order of the Church, are ſaide to haue bin deliuered of the Lorde, and are called preceptes and commaundements, yea and ſometimes commaundements of the Lorde. Finallie, the ſame externall order of the Church in offices for doctrine, conuerſation, and for the poore, was ſetled by the Apoſtle in all churches where he came, and in ſome before he had conferred with any of the other Apoſtles, and had the Goſpell only by reuelation of the Sonne of God.

In the time next ſucceding the Apoſtles, the ſame order in a great part continued, as may appeare by many notable teſtimonies in <hi>Jgnatius,</hi> not onely mentioning and ſaluting in all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles often times the Miniſters of the worde by the name of Biſhops, Elders, and Deacons: but alſo earneſtly exhorting to the continuance and reſpect of them as a moſt neceſſarie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appointed for the preſeruation of Gods Church. <hi>Be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>to the Biſhop,</hi> meaning the Paſtour, (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the particular reſpect he is ſaid to haue to that church) <hi>as to the Lorde, for he watcheth for your ſoules as one that is to giue his account thereof to God, &amp;c. Be ſubiect alſo</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>to th'Elderſhip, as the Apostles of Jeſus Christ, and pleaſe the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</hi> A litle after he ſayth, <hi>The Biſhop reſembleth God vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the Elders the aſſistance of God, and colledge or bande of the Apostles of Christ</hi> (a compariſon in ſundrie other places vſed by him) <hi>without theſe an elect Church, a holy aſſemblie, a Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Saints is not, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſame Epi. <hi>He that is within the Church is cleane, therefore obeyeth he the Biſhop and the Elders: but he that is without, doeth any thing without Biſhoppe, without Elders and Deacons, ſuch an one is vncleane: for what is the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, but the follower of Christ: what is the Presbiterie or Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but a holy aſſemblie, Councellours and aſſistantes of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: what are the Deacons, but followers of the Aungelles, &amp;c. He therefore that diſobeyeth theſe, is ſurelie an Atheist, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie, deſpiſing Christ and ſetting at nought his ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Epiſtle to the ſaintes at <hi>Tharſus,</hi> vſing the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, I loue them, ſaieth he, as mine owne ſoule, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this good order, and the Lord be with them for euer.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he ſaieth, The Preſbyterie is to the Biſhop as the ſtring is to the Harpe, as no doubt their holy concorde is acceptable to God like the ſong of the golden harpes, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Reuelation.<note place="margin">Apoc. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Justinus</hi> maketh mention of ſuch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19103:10"/> an order of lethargie vſed by the Chriſtians in their holy ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall aſſemblies as may ſeeme to haue bin (as there was good cauſe it ſhould) the paterne of the beſt reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this age for th'order of publique prayer vſed amongſt them. <hi>Tertullianus</hi> teſtimonie in his excellent Apologie of Chriſtians is worthie to be written with a pen of gold in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious marble, which is that certaine approued Elders were ſet ouer their Churches &amp; eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned that honor not by mony but by good teſtimonie. For no matter of God is obtayned with vs by money. Many and notable witneſſes are in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of the miniſterie and their equall power and dignitie, and of ſo great neceſſitie of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the cenſures and diſcipline of the Church, as that feare of death ought not to hinder it. The preſumption of man in deede began betimes by degrees to degenerate from this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Diſcipline, ſo as the Elders, who were men choſen out from the reſt of the people to aſſiſte the Miniſters of the word in the execution of the Diſcipline of the Church began to fayle, whereof <hi>Ambroſe</hi> complayned in his time.<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in 2. Tim. 5.</note> So it came to paſſe that ſome of the Miniſters of the worde, not by the ordinance of God, whereby they were all equall, but as <hi>Ierome</hi> noteth, by cuſtome and humane diſpoſition began to be greater then other Miniſters,<note place="margin">Iero. in epi. ad Tit.</note> ſo as they onely were called Biſhops (which name is giuen to all the Elders of the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi>) and tooke vpon them, firſte all the care of the Church, then of other Miniſters alſo, and that, by degrees,<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> of ſo large circuites, as for their helpe and to ſerue for ſteppes to rayſe them ſelues by, other officers were appointed vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, till at laſt, it grewe to this perfect image of the beaſt, ſpoken of in the Reuelation, that is, of the <hi>Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> that of long time hath tyranniſed the Church of God,<note place="margin">Reue. 13.14.</note> euer to this age. But in this age of the regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the Churches haue openlie and plainlie diſcouered theſe abuſes, and declared both their iudgementes what they iudge
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19103:11"/> and beleeue touching the kindes of the miniſteries &amp; offices ordayned of God to be in the Church: and their indeuour &amp; deſire to returne to the ſame former order appointed by our Sauiour Chriſt, and firſt deliuered to the Churches by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Apoſtles. In the latter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of the churches of <hi>Helue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> wherunto beſides the <hi>Heluetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> that is the churches of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rich, Bearne, Shaphonſe, Sangall, Rhetia, Millynſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bienna:</hi> there ſubſcribed alſo the Churches of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and of <hi>Sauoye, Polelande, Hungarie,</hi> and <hi>Scotlande,</hi> after a declaration of the names of the Miniſterie that are mentioned in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it is thus written. But moreouer in the tymes which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, manie more names of Miniſters of the Church were brought in, for ſome were ordayned Patriarkes, other Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, others Suffragans, Metropolitanes alſo and Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſtes, or Arch-preſbyters, alſo Subdeacons, Acolythes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſtes, Singers, porters, and I knowe not who els, as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, Prouoſtes, Priors, Fathers, and orders greater and leſſe. But of all theſe we are nothinge carefull what they were in times paſt, or nowe are, the doctrine of the Apoſtles concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Miniſters ſuffiſeth vs. And a little after in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, one and equall power or office was giuen to all the Miniſters of the Church.</p>
            <p>Surelie at the beginning the Biſhops gouerned the Church by their common labour, none preferred him ſelfe before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or vſurped to him ſelfe larger power or dominion ouer Biſhops, for they were mindefull of the Lords wordes: <hi>Hee that will be first amongst you, let him be your ſeruaunt,</hi> and ſo forth with confirmation of this equalitie amongeſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church, ſhewing this to haue bene ſo amongſt the Apoſtles, by <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Jeromes</hi> teſtimonie, affirminge, that the Biſhoppes are greater then other Miniſters, more by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome then by the ordinance of God, and that they ought to rule the Church togither, they adde theſe wordes, this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Ierome.</hi> Therefore ſay they, no man can lawfullie forbid
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19103:11"/> vs to returne backe agayne to the auncient ordinance of the Church of God,<note place="margin">Artic. 29.</note> and to receyue that rather then a humane cuſtome. The Churches of France write yet more directlie to this purpoſe, in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, ſaying: We beleeue the true Church ought to be gouerned by that pollicie and diſcipline which our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath ordayned, namely ſo, that there be in that, Paſtours, Elders and Deacons, that the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of doctrine may be retayned, vices may be ſuppreſſed, the poore and other in miſerie may be prouided for, and that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aſſemblies may be helde, for the edification both of ſmall and great. In like maner write the Churches of the lowe Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries:<note place="margin">Artic. 30.</note> We beleeue (ſay they) that this true Church ought to be ruled and gouerned by that ſpirituall pollicie which god him ſelfe hath taught vs by his worde: ſo as there be in it Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Miniſters, who may purely preache and adminiſter the Sacramentes. Alſo, that there be Elders and Deacons, who may make the Seniorie of that Church, that by theſe, as meanes, true Religion may be preſerued, &amp; true doctrine may be retayned euery-where, and ſpead abroade, &amp;c. as followeth in the ſame place of the vſe of this order. Wherein it is verie worthie the obſeruation that theſe Churches wherein there are an infinite number of godly learned men, and many for their iuſt deſertes, famous, reuerend, and honourable in all the Church of Chriſt, and the ſame being in perſecution, and therefore ſeeking more carefullie to pleaſe God, in ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as they declare their faith in, haue thought it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie Article to ſet downe this point of the pollicie or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church: and that, in declaring of it, they ſaye not, what they ſuppoſe: but what they beleeue, vſing the ſame worde which they doe vſe in the articles of fayth &amp; doctrine. Further alſo it is to be marked, that they profeſſe, they beleue, the Church ought to be gouerned, by that policie and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath ordayned, and God him ſelfe hath taught vs by his worde: plainlie affirming that there is a certayne forme of policie to gouerne the church by,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19103:12"/> and that the ſame is ordeyned of our Sauiour Chriſt, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is declared in the worde of God. And laſt of all, that they declare that policie or diſcipline which GOD hath taught vs in his worde, to be this in effect, That there bee Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the worde, Elders and Deacons, by whom, as by the meanes which God hath ordeyned, holy doctrine, and honeſt life, may be preſerued in the Church, and the poore relieued. The ſame is likewiſe affirmed by the Church of <hi>Scotlande,</hi> as appeareth in their treatiſe of the Diſcipline of the Church. Vpon all which proofes and teſtimonies, I conclude with the declaration: That God hath giuen to the church, which is the houſe of the liuing God, a certayne order for the direction of it, in all outward matters that belong to the good gouuerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame. Whereof if they ſhall yet doubt, whome it moſt importeth the Chureh to be perſuaded of it, it is to bee ſued for by continuall ſupplications and prayers to God and them, that they would heare what we haue to ſay further on Gods behalfe in theſe cauſes, and to receyue our information herein, ſo farre as we ſhalbe able to make good proofe by the holy worde of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his ordinance in theſe matters. I doubt not then but the certayne trueth of the pointes ſett downe in the declaration, would appeare vnto them to the great honour of God, and vnſpeakeable ioy and comfort of all the Church amongſt vs.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the third and laſt ſentence of thoſe which are ſet downe for the foundation of all the Diſcipline. This ſentence is, that the order which God hath preſcribed for the directing of his church is not to be learned elſ-where then in the holy worde of God. For proofe whereof is alleadged 2. Tim. 3. verſ. 16.17. This trueth, the Replyer, if hee agree with him ſelfe, in like maner yeeldeth vnto, with this condition, if it be vnderſtoode, that all generall or particular orders in the externall gouernement of the church, are either expreſlie ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in Gods holy worde, or incluſiuelie comprehended in it. This is the ſubſtance of his Replie to this point, wherein he is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19103:12"/> to knowe that it is not otherwiſe meant, but that eyther by playne euidence, or neceſſarie conſequence, they are to bee ſhewed to haue their ground in the worde of God, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therfore of this point we are agreed. In this place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all maner of occaſion offred him, he falleth into the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a booke which he termeth <hi>our communion booke,</hi> and ſayth to be intituled, <hi>The forme of common prayers, adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacramentes, &amp;c. agreeable to Gods worde and the vſe of the reformed Churches.</hi> Such a booke in deede bearing that tytle, there hath bin much ſpeach of, &amp; it is ſaide, as it had bin twiſe before, ſo this laſt Parliament, nowe the thirde time, to haue bin preſented to that high and Honorable Court. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of becauſe the ſpeaches were diuers, many haue bin in doubt what they ſhould iudge of it. Therefore I doubt not, but that one no better affected to it then he is, and ſheweth him ſelfe to be, both in calling it our communion booke (meaning as it ſeemeth that it was reuiſited and conſidered by ſundrie fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of the Goſpell, and by their meanes procured to be preſented in Parliament) and in his readines to finde faulte with it without cauſe: but he hath obſerued ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matter in it, that may ſtay the vncertayne and doubtfull opinions of many concerning it, and may certifie them vpon good and ſufficient grounde of iuſt cauſe to diſallowe it. The matter which he noteth in it, is, that in the title of it, it is ſayd to be agreeable to the worde of God, and the vſe of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churches. And this is all that he noteth in it: whereby it may ſeeme to be a holy booke, and worthie to bee written in letters of golde, if it bee ſuch a one as ſo ill an eye lookinge into it, could finde nothing reproueable in it, but this, that it is agreeable to Gods worde and the vſe of the beſt reformed Churches. He might eaſilie finde as great a ſtayne as this is, in the moſt orient pearle that euer came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Indies. Such a pearle was in deede worthie to bee ſet in the Diademe of a Prince, and meete to be preſented to ſo noble a State, as is the State of that honourable aſſemblie. If there were a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19103:13"/> in all the lande, fearing God in trueth, with ſinglenes and ſinceritie of harte, wiſe, without cunning and deceytfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, zealous of the honor and ſeruice of God, louing his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey with moſt tender affection &amp; conſtant in the trueth, with a chriſtian magnanimitie: ſuch a man ſurelie were a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage qualified for ſuch a purpoſe, as to make tender to the States of a lande, of ſuch a booke, as is agreable to Gods word, and the vſe of the beſt reformed Churches. If amongeſt all the Gentlemen of a Countrey, there were two, graced of God with rare and excellent giftes, of true pitie and zeale, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding in other good learning, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie in the heauenlie knowledge of diuinitie, and in it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie of the Diſcipline and ſpiritual pollicie of the church, and of ſo gracious ſpeach &amp; vtterance, that the hearers might after truelie report and ſaye of them: Wee ſawe them as men that looked into the glorie of God, and had bin chaunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſimilitude and likenes of the Lordes owne glorie: wee heard them, as they that ſeemed to vs to ſpeake not with the tongues of men, but of Aungelles: for howe did our hartes burne within vs, when we hearde them ſo zealouſlie &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie pleade on the behalf of God, and perſwade the receyuing of a booke that had all things in it agreeable to Gods worde, and the vſe of the beſt reformed churches: ſurelie ſuch men were fitt aduocates to ſpeake in a cauſe ſo holy, and ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the honour of God, and the comfort of his people. If there were in the Miniſterie, true and faithfull ſeruauntes of God, ſuch as ſeeke not them ſelues, but the thinges that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt Ieſus: And if there were of euerie Countrie men indued with pitie, knowledge, wiſedome, care of the Church, the flowre of a lande, aſſembled togither: theſe were in deede for ſuch a purpoſe, to laye their heades togither, and to conferre, howe they might with moſt grace, ſet out ſuch a iewell, to winne fauor, &amp; to drawe loue whereſoeuer it ſhould be ſeene, and eſpeciallie of thoſe who ſhould moſt of all take pleaſure in iewelles of price. For, wherein could any mans
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19103:13"/> giftes be better imployed, then in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending for publique prayers and adminiſtration of the Sacramentes, ſuch a booke, as is agreeable with the worde of God, and the vſe of the beſt reformed Churches. Belike ſuch a booke mainteyned not an vnlearned miniſterie, nor a pontificall Hierarchie, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie goe togither, and vpholde one another, nor reading of Apocripha rather then Canonicall ſcriptures in the publique aſſemblie of the Church, nor priuate adminiſtration of the Sacra. nor caſes of neceſſitie of them, implying the erroneous doctrine of conference of grace by them for the deede done, nor the baptiſme of women, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation, as an ordinance to giue increaſe of grace, nor Biſhops of a ſeuerall ordination and power from other Paſtours, nor Deacons without anie charge of the poore, nor power to miniſter baptiſme without like power to adminiſter the Lordes ſupper, nor to miniſter both without power to preach, except further licence be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted: theſe &amp; ſuch like matters, no doubt, ſuch a booke could not mainteyne it being apparant, what the worde of God is herein, and the vſe of the reformed churches. Contrariwiſe, it muſt needes be that ſuch a booke appointeth that all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Sacra. ſhould be preachers, that preaching bee ioyned alwayes with the miniſterie of the Sacramentes, and that they be alwayes miniſtred in the publique aſſemblie, that they bee not diuided from preaching, nor one from another in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours calling, that the Deacons relieue the poore, and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip direct the cauſes of the church: theſe &amp; other pointes like vnto them, being declared in the worde of God, to be the ordinances of the almightie for the guydance of his Church, and this being the vſe of the reformed Churches, no doubt, but they were mainteyned by a booke agreeing with them both. Which being ſo, what ſhould I ſay of them, that would endeuor to the vttermoſt of their power, by all good and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull meanes, the receyuing of a booke ſo fitt for the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement of the honour of God, and promiſing ſo great good vnto his people: but as it is in the Pſalme: Peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19103:14"/> be in thee (ô Ieruſalem) thou citie of God, and the Lord proſper thoſe that loue thee.<note place="margin">Pſal. 122.6.</note> The Almightie ſuffer them not to feare the feare of the wicked, but ſhield them from all euil, as the naturall and noble ſonnes of Abraham:<note place="margin">Gene 15.3.</note> and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be dealt with here, the Lord recompence them with an exceeding great rewarde. Hee remember them for good, according to the prayer of that worthie reſtorer of the Citie, &amp; ſeruice of God <hi>Nehemia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nem. 5.19.13.12.29.</note> and what ſoeuer they haue done for this people, their endeuour to take away the pollutions of the miniſterie, to ſet the Lords watch at his gates again, &amp; euerie Leuite to his worke, according to his place: the Lorde ſpare them according to the greatnes of his mercie, and remember them and their ſeruice for good, ſo as their childrens children may receyue at their handes an inheritance of bleſſing from the Lorde. And if any ſhould be otherwiſe minded, the Lord forgiue it them, and graunt that they alſo in his good time, may haue this trueth opened to them, and be noble and elect inſtrumentes choſen and appointed of God to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thus farre, haue I bin bolde, to folowe th'occaſion offered me, in mencion of a booke of common prayer and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacramentes, agreeable to Gods worde, and the vſe of the beſt reformed Churches. The whiche I am, for their ſakes, who ſeeke all aduantages, to ſtirre vp the higher powers againſt vs, truely and vnfeynedlie to proteſt, that I write not with purpoſe to offende anie, God being witnes, and leaſt of all, any that are in authoritie. For I bowe my face downe to the grounde before them all, of whom it is ſaide, <hi>Ye are Gods,</hi> and in all reuerent duetie, acknowledging the moſt humble and faithfull duetie which I owe to the great power, that God hath giuen them, <hi>to the puniſhing onely of the euill doer: but to the protection, maintenance and comfort of all that doe well in the lande:</hi> yea further, as conſcience and duetie bindeth mee in that reſpect, I doe not ceaſe to lift vp my harte and my handes to Almightie GOD, day and night for them all, that it maye
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19103:14"/> pleaſe him dailie more and more to increaſe in them, all the princelie giftes that their high places and authoritie doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: and namely, that their hartes may bee more enlarged towardes this ſo neceſſarie a cauſe of Gods ſeruice, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort of his people, which I doe alſo as my moſt ſtraight bound and obligation requireth: eſpeciallie, for our ſoueraigne La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the Queene, that as God in his mercie hath honoured hir right excellent Maieſtie, with theſe honors: th'extinguiſhing of the fires wherewith the Church conſumed, the ouerthrowe of idolatrie, and falſe worſhip of God, the eſtabliſhing of the free profeſſing and preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſte, the harbouring of exiles for the goſpels ſake, the deliuering of the Churches of <hi>Scotlande</hi> from captiuitie, patronizing of the Churches of the lowe Countries, ayding and aſſiſting of the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> and the comforting (in a manner) of all the Churches which profeſſe the goſpell, that I ſay to theſe ſo manie and ſo highe and chiefe pointes of true honor, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may be added, that hir Maieſtie by Gods ſpeciall fauour, &amp; aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, may eſtabliſhe in this hir happie raigne, the ſame order for directing of the Church, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the goſpell of ſaluation to all the people within hir Dominion, which almightie GOD hath appointed for this purpoſe: to the great aduancement of the honour of GOD, the exceeding ioye of all the good people in the lande, and hir owne vnſpeakeable comfort and glorie with God and men. Thus, praying not to be miſconſtrued in that I haue bin bold, vpon occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſpeake a little to the incouragement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and noble mindes, in godlie and duetifull maner, to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite almightie God, and th'authoritie he hath ſet ouer vs, in Syons ſute, being ſo neceſſarie, and ſo importinge the good, both of the Church and common wealth amongeſt vs, (the happie eſtate whereof dependeth vpon the fauour of God:) I returne to the Replier. To whom for his replie of agreeable, I anſwere, that agreeable is not that which is contrarie, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath a correſpondence and harmonicall concorde with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19103:15"/> that wherewith it agreeth. And ſo is it to be vnderſtood in the place whereof he maketh queſtion: but ſuch a ſence woulde he fayne make of agreeable, to ſaue all vpright in an other place, which yet will not ſerue, for ſundrie repugnances &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties which are there with the word, &amp; with the vſe of the beſt reformed Churches. And thus farre to his replie, to the matter ſet downe in the thirde part of the foundation.</p>
            <p>Nowe to his replie to the reaſon wherewith it is confirmed: The proofe alleadged for this thirde point he admitteth not ſo eaſilie, as the matter it ſelfe. Which being grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be true, it importeth the leſſe, whether it be fitly proued by it or no, yit peraduenture hee would better haue diſcerned of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from that place, if he had conſidered, the man of God there, to note, not the ciuill Magiſtrate, nor euery one of the faithfull, but only the Miniſter of the word, as both the terme it ſelfe, and the dueties of his calling there mentioned doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. Whereby it is playne that the wordes of the Apoſtle doe more particularlie concerne matters of the Church, then they doe ciuill pollicie or morall life, as he obiecteth. Nowe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaide, that the miniſter of the worde (whoſe calling is the greateſt in the Church) is fullie and throughlie inſtructed by the holy ſcriptures, for euery duetie belonging to his office. Surelie the Elders and Deacons, whoſe charges are leſſe, may be taught by the ſame what belongeth vnto them, and if they furniſhe and direct him, that requireth moſt furniture and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: ſurelie then, they can not want, that neede leſſe. And if all that are of publike charge in the Church, be fully inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and inabled of God for euerie parte and pointe of their dueties by the holy ſcriptures, what one, concerning the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, can be ſaide, not to be taught in the word of God: ſeeing the whole Diſcipline is adminiſtred by thoſe that beare publique charge in the church. If this proofe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him not, he is to be ſatisfied further in the proofes of the ſeuerall pointes which are ſhewed after, to be fullie grounded vpon the worde of God. In the meane time this I adde for his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19103:15"/> further ſatisfaction. It being neceſſarie to be directed in theſe matters from God, it muſt needes be, that God hath left vs this direction in his worde: otherwiſe, he muſt confeſſe, there are neceſſarie truthes, not written in the worde: but this popiſhe opinion of vnwritten verities, is worthilie reiected of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the goſpell long agoe. For we can not nowe ſay to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abiathar,</hi> take the Ephod,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 23.9</note> and aske of the Lord: we haue no other Ephod, nor other <hi>Vrim</hi> &amp; <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mim</hi> left vs from the Lord, whereby we may be certified of his good pleaſure in anie thing, but onely the bright gliſtering, &amp; pure light of his H. Scriptures: wherein, as in the breſt of our hye prieſt Ieſus Chriſt, we may ſee and reade the will of God for our direction. Nowe, that we neede in theſe matters to be directed by God, appeareth by this, that of our ſelues wee can not by any natural vnderſtanding attayne to this knowledge: <hi>For, the naturall man, comprehendeth not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 7.20.21</note> 
               <hi>the ſpirituall things of God.</hi> For which cauſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> a man otherwiſe of great giftes of nature and of ſtudie, as one in whoſe face the grace of God appeared, and who had bin brought vp in all the learning and knowledge of the Egiptians, and that by ſuch excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and meanes, as were meete for him, that was reſpected in his education, as grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d-childe to the King of Egipt: yet ſtoode he in neede, to be inſtructed of God, in as ſmall matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the outward guydance of his church, as are any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned in the declaration, and much ſmaller. Further alſo, the Apoſtle affirmeth, that the thinges he wrote to <hi>Timothie,</hi> hee wrote them, that he might knowe,<note place="margin">1 Ti. 3.14.15</note> how to behaue him ſelf in the Church, which is the houſe of the liuing God.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.5.</note> And if Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy an Euangeliſt, one of whoſe miniſterie the Prophetes had ſpoken before,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.18</note> one that had receyued the faith from his anceſtors,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.5.</note> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle for the likenes he had of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical ſpirit, calleth <hi>his naturall ſonne,</hi> ſtood notwithſtanding in need to be informed by writing from the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.2.</note> howe he ſhould behaue him ſelf in the church, and that in ſo many par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticulars, as he inſtructeth him in: ſure it muſt needes be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be neceſſarie for all other to be taught alſo by writing,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19103:16"/> (which is the moſt certayne way of inſtruction) howe they ought to behaue themſelues in the ſame. If it were not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be taught by the Apoſtles, howe a man ſhould behaue him ſelfe in guyding the houſe of God, why did the Apoſtle write to <hi>Timothie</hi> to this ende, to direct him in that he had to doe in the Church. And, if it were needefull for <hi>Timothie,</hi> why is it not as neceſſarie for all others? This reaſon mouing the Apoſtle to write of this matter to <hi>Timothie,</hi> no doubt, did cauſe him likewiſe for the ſame ende, to write to <hi>Titus,</hi> of the like matters. And if ſo excellent perſonages vnderſtoode not what to doe, nor howe to behaue them ſelues in the Church, for that which appertayned to them, in the adminiſtration of it, without certaine direction in writing concerning it, from the Apoſtles: I can not thinke, but the like direction ſhould be needfull for all thoſe, who haue anie charge in the church. When <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> ſonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſte,<note place="margin">Leui. 10.2.</note> had bin conſumed with fire from before the Lorde, for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouerning them ſelues in an outwarde thinge, concerninge their Miniſterie (in a matter as it might ſeeme to fleſhe and blood, of ſmall importance) <hi>Moſes</hi> tolde <hi>Aaron</hi> his brother, that this was ſo come to paſſe, according to that the Lorde had ſaide,<note place="margin">Leui. 10.3.</note> 
               <hi>I wilbe ſanctified in thoſe that come neare vnto me, &amp; glorified in the ſight of all the people:</hi> meaning thereby, that God had forewarned the Prieſtes, that if they miſbehaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in their miniſterie, he would glorifie him ſelfe in their examplarie and grieuous puniſhment. Which being ſo, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the fault and puniſhement can not be ſmall, nor to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, if anie of thoſe who come neare to the Lorde to ſtande and miniſter before him, in the time of the goſpell, ſhall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouerne them ſelues in their charge. Therefore, neceſſarie it is, and that moſte neceſſarie, that there bee direction for them in the worde of GOD. And thus much alſo to this point.</p>
            <p>In the next ſection, which the replier maketh of the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it is gathered of the former ſentences, that wee are to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19103:16"/> ſearche the Scriptures, that we may finde that order whiche is left in them for the guydance of the Church. The firſt thing the Replyer reproueth in this ſection, is, that it is ſaide, <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not preuayle against the foundation before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned.</hi> Who may eaſilie ſatisfie him ſelf for this obiection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the meaning of the Declaration was not to alleadge thoſe wordes, as ſpoken of that it intreates of, it being appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to be meant of the Church, buylded vpon the Prophetes and Apoſtles, Chriſt Ieſus being the foundation-ſtone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: (ſomewhat otherwiſe then he hath taken it, who expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it of Chriſt him ſelfe) but by theſe wordes, although v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that place to another ende, it declareth the ſure ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that doctrine which was a litle before mencioned, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che being as the declaration intendeth, and as it is in deede, a part of the heauenlie trueth of the worde of God, whiche can not fayle in any part of the ſame: it was trulie ſpoken alſo of the matter it is applied vnto.</p>
            <p>Of the word <hi>foundation</hi> he taketh occaſion to ſet downe the 1. Corinth. 3. ver. 10.11.12.13.14.15. where mencion is made of the foundation Chriſt Ieſus, and of buylding vpon it ſtraw or ſtubble, which he ſayth they doe, that vrge anie outwarde order of eccleſiaſticall gouernement, as matter of ſaluation. After, where it is ſaide in the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon former proofes, that we ought therefore diligentlie and reuerentlie to ſearche the holy Scriptures, to finde what the order is whiche GOD hath appointed for his Church: he anſwereth with ſcoffing &amp; reprochefull ſpeaches, without any iuſt matter of rebuke. And in the ende of his replye to this ſection, becauſe it is ſaid in the declaration, we are to ſearch in Gods worde, that order, by which God would haue his Church directed in all thinges appertayning to the ſaluation thereof. He replyeth, that this were to condemne all the Churches, where this order hath not bin obſerued: which eyther if it be neceſſarie to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, could not be the Churches of God without it, or if it bee not neceſſarie, it is (ſaith he) vnneceſſarie to ſaluation, &amp; then
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19103:17"/> our Church may remayne, gouuerned as it is, without either being deformed, maymed, or no church, as ſome affirme, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he nameth as in reproch. For anſwere to theſe thinges, and to begin where he leaueth, that is, with the perſons he nameth, the former of them we acknowledge,<note place="margin">M. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright.</note> &amp; reuerence, as his rare giftes of knowledge and zeale, and his learned workes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſuffring in this cauſe, and at this time his continuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in preaching the goſpell, doe worthilie deſerue: for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che cauſes he was worthie other reſpect then the Replier here doeth giue him. If he would needes ſett downe his name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the example of the Apoſtle, who (notwithſtandinge he farre excelled in office and in giftes) yet ſeldome or neuer mencioneth anie Miniſter of the goſpell by name, yea ſcarſe any profeſſour, without ſome good marke of the grace of god in them: but this and a great deale more, both he and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhall ſerue God as they ought in this cauſe of the further reformation of our Church muſt account to endure of them that oppoſe them ſelues to this moſt neceſſarie ſeruice. As for the other, that he obiecteth to him, concerneth not any of thoſe, in whoſe name the Declaration was publiſhed.</p>
            <p>But for the matter of neceſsitie, this worde being taken as hath bin aboue declared a little before in this defence, it may ſtande well inough togither, to ſay as the declaration ſayeth, that God hath ſet downe in his worde, an order to direct his Church in all things partayning to the ſaluation of it, and yet that ſome Churches may be worthilie acknowledged the true Churches of God, although they haue not in all pointes kept that order. For all the things in that order, doe not in like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree partayne to ſaluation: which if they did, his reaſon were good, but it being otherwiſe, fayleth. He him ſelfe, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, acknowledgeth outward orders in their degrees, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to edification: though (ſayth he) not directlie partay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the neceſſitie of ſaluation, which we agree to be true in ſome, but that he addeth there, nor to the neceſſitie of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is not true in ſuch orders as haue their particular
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19103:17"/> grounde in the worde of God: which point becauſe he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto agayne in this place, and often hereafter, hee is to vnderſtande his anſwere herein once for all: which is, as hath bin partlie touched before, that certayne pointes of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, are of neceſſitie to ſaluation, in ſuch abſolute degree of neceſſitie, as is of any ordinarie outward meanes. Of which ſorte is the miniſterie of the worde, and of the Sacramentes, and of the cenſures of the Church, whiche are appointed for the winning of th'offendour, and for the ſauing of his ſpirite in the day of the Lorde, as we are expreſlie taught by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt in the goſpell: and by the Apoſtle Paule in the 5.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> of his former Epiſtle to the Corinthians.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> Wherevppon it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie followeth, that the ſufficiencie of the miniſterie to teache, and to exhort according to ſound doctrine, and to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uince the gayn-ſayer: likewiſe their ordinarie reſidence, and diligent attendance vpon the Church, whoſe ſeruantes they are in the Lord, is partayning to the ſaluation of ſoules. For it is ſaide, <hi>That where viſion or propheſie,</hi> that is interpretation of ſcriptures <hi>fayleth, there the people periſheth or is made naked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro 1.29.18.</note> that is, expoſed to all daunger,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.36.</note> and our Sauior Chriſt yearned in his bowelles vpon the people, ſeeing them as ſheepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhepheardes, that is, in daunger to be made a praye to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that roaring Lion, <hi>who goeth about co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuallie to ſeeke whom he may deuoure.</hi> In like maner, becauſe this is the vſe of the cenſures to ſerue immediatlie to the recouerie of the ſinner to repentance, that he may be ſaued, the office of Elders, who are by the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, to keepe the Lords watch ouer the Church, and to procure the repentance of the ſinner, is in his place neceſſarie: which thing being neceſſarie, it followeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that other inferior meanes which ſerue herevnto, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which theſe holy offices can not bee thus eſtabliſhed, nor diſcharged, are in their degree alſo neceſſarie. The Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons office is not ſo directlie tending to the ſaluation of the ſoule, as theſe are, but rather regardeth the reliefe of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde neceſſities of the poore and afflicted of the Churche,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19103:18"/> yet not without reſpect to comfort and confirme their faith in him, by whoſe holy ordinance they are ſo prouided for. But being as it is, the ordinance of God, that there ſhould be Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons in the Church for ſuch vſes, this office is alſo of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of obedience. And generallie, ſo are all the offices and orders ſett downe in the Declaration, becauſe they are all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned of God, to be kept for great and neceſſarie vſe in the church, to the ende of the world: as it is to be iuſtified in their ſeuerall places, when we come vnto them. So as this is brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that we affirme herein, that ſundrie pointes of the matters of the eccleſiaſticall pollicie ſet downe in the Declaration, are directlie partayning to ſaluation, and in that reſpect neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and both they and all the reſt, are by the appointment and ordinance of God, to be continued in the Church, and in the neceſſitie of obedience, they are all likewiſe neceſſarie. Yet where this order appointed of God is not kept, by reaſon of ignorance, and wante of due information of the will of God, or meanes to performe it, or of humane infirmitie, ſuch as fleſh and blood is ſubiect vnto: it followeth not, that they are therefore no church of God. The holy ordinances of God, were horribly profaned by the ſonnes of <hi>Elie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.17</note> ſo as, for their abhominations the people of God began to abhorre the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, yet was the Church of God ſtill amongſt them. The Prophetes in their time charged the Prieſtes with breach of the couenant that God had made with <hi>Leui</hi> their Father,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.5.8.</note> with their ignorance,<note place="margin">Eſai. 29.</note> in being a number of them not able to teache the people, with their flatteries, and bolſtring vp of the ſinnes of all eſtates and degrees,<note place="margin">Eſa. 56.10.</note> and ſaying all was well, when there were a number of thinges that needed reformation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them,<note place="margin">Iere. 6.13.14</note> they charged them with ambition, with coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes,<note place="margin">Iere 8.8 9.11.12.</note> with prophanenes, and many other great enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: yet did the Prophetes continue their teaching of the people, and acknowledged the people notwithſtandinge to be the people of God. Yea, euen what the people offered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the highe places and the Lordes altar was remoued and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19103:18"/> put to the wall, and the altar of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> ſett in the place thereof: all which were notable breaches of that externall order which God had commaunded to be obſerued by them: yet were they not therefore ſtraightway no people of God as were the Gentiles. God did in deede grieuouſlie puniſh them by warre, by famine, by peſtilence, and ſundrie other wayes, declaring him ſelfe to be highlie offended at theſe their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, as the Prophetes forewarned them hee would doe: but this correction was yet with the Fathers rodde, and not with the barre of Iron, till ſuch time, as by the iuſt iudgement of God, the ſtate of that people became worſe and worſe, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from one degree of ſinne to another, till at laſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Prince of life, &amp; crucified the Lorde of glorie: Then the Lord in part reiected them for their vnbeliefe, &amp; brought in the Gentiles that beleeued. But till that time, the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged them for his, euen as a Father doeth his childe, notwithſtanding he be maymed or deformed. Which compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon the Replier without cauſe is offended at,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.13.</note> this being an vſuall thing in the ſcriptures, to reſemble ſinnes and offences to imperfections &amp; deformities of the body. For which cauſe the Euangeliſt <hi>Matthewe,</hi> mentioning the healing of bodilie infirmities by our Sauiour Chriſt, noteth that therein (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a viſible euidence of th'other) was fulfilled that, whiche was written by the Prophet Eſaie ſaying: <hi>He tooke our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and bare our diſeaſes vpon him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 8.17.</note> Likewiſe alſo the Apoſtle exhorting to holy exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of lyfe, ſayth: <hi>Make ſtraight ſteppes vnto your feete, that that which is halting be not turned out of the way, but may bee healed rather.</hi> And <hi>howe long</hi> (ſayeth Elias to Iſrael) <hi>doe you halte betweene two: Jf God be God, followe him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Kin. 18.21</note> 
               <hi>and if Baal be god, followe him.</hi> I adde further, which toucheth the matter yet more neare.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle compareth the Church vnto a body,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.27.28.</note> and the particular perſons of it to the partes and members of a body and the guydes of the Churche and ſuch as haue publique charge in it, to the more noble and principall partes of it,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19103:19"/> whereof Chriſt our Sauiour is the onely head. As therfore the body is blinde that wanteth eyes to ſee withall, &amp; lame, may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or deformed, whereof the ſhoulders, armes, handes, or other principall partes are wanting or diſplaced and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: ſo that body of a Church can not be ſaid to be perfect &amp; entier, wherein there are not Miniſters of the worde, who by the light thereof may direct the people in the wayes of God, or Elders that may diſcouer &amp; deſcrie euery matter that may threaten anie daunger to the body: or Deacons who may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute liberallie according to that is in their handes, for the reliefe of the poore. Nay I doubt not to ſay (the neceſſarie vſe of theſe offices being conſidered) that no body naturall, hath ſo much wante of any of theſe, as the body politike of the church hath of the other. Therefore I ſee no iuſt cauſe, why this compariſon ſhould greatlie offende him. A man maye liue in deede many yeares with ſuch wantes and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, none of thoſe partes being neceſſarie for life, but ſhal liue a heauie and vncomfortable life, becauſe hee wanteth partes, that are neceſſarie for many great vſes, whereby a Man may liue the better and more comfortably, as being preſerued in health, in ſtrength, and in beautie: which thing they well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of, who wanting by anie occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch partes, vſe a hand or a legg of woode, or helpe the imperfections of other partes as well as they can. So likewiſe a church may liue, and be the Church of God, whileſt the faith of Chriſt, as the breath and ſpirite of life is in it, but wanting theſe offices, or in place of theſe which God hath made, and are the natural partes of the body, hauing a ſupplie and helpe ſuch as Man hath deuiſed, ſhall ſo liue, as one neither hauing beautie in the ſight of god and his holy Angelles, nor force and health to performe in good order the actions belonging to it, but pineth &amp; waſteth away with diſcomfort, one part decaying after another, till in the ende the ſpirit of life, the doctrine of the Goſpell, in the iuſt iudgement of God forſaking it, leaue a dead corps vppon the ground, to warne and admoniſh other Churches by ſuch
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19103:19"/> example, to be carefull in time, of the meanes, whereby tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the bleſſing of God vppon his owne holy ordinances, according to the promiſe he hath made in the vſe of them, &amp; not of anie humane deuiſe to like purpoſe, (bee it neuer ſo pollitique and reaſonable to fleſh and bloud) they may be in health, ſtrength, beautie, and honor, preſerued and maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for euer.</p>
            <p>There remayneth yet to aunſwere his miſapplying of the wordes of the Apoſtle in the 3. of the former epiſt. to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, concerning the laying of ſtubble and ſtrawe vppon the foundation, which he ſayth is done by thoſe, who holding Chriſt, and the doctrine of the Goſpell, will vrge a neceſſitie of the outward regiment of the Church in all Eccleſiaſticall matters. Wherein howe iuſtlie hee chargeth ſuch as ſeeke a further reformation of our charge, may appeare by that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath bin ſayde alreadie, and is further to be made playne by the reſt of this treatiſe: Wherin euery parte of the doctrine ſet downe in the declaration being ſufficienlie proued by the worde of God, the day will witnes for vs, that wee haue layde vpon the moſt riche and precious foundation, nothinge but fine golde of Ophir, and ſiluer refined ſeuen times in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. On the other parte, the ſame light will make manifeſt their worke, that vpon Chriſt the corner ſtone, layde in Syon, elect, and precious, laye thinges altogither vnſuteable to it, matter of no value, and whoſe ende is to bee conſumed with fire. Of this ſorte is the adminiſtration of holy thinges, as Baptiſme, and the cenſures of the Church, by Women, &amp; lay men, ſuch as are Chauncelours, Commiſſaries, Officialls, and ſuch like, the confuſion of both powers eccleſiaſticall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, in perſons called to the miniſterie and preaching of the worde of God. In Eccleſiaſticall matters ſo immoderate a power, as that one man at his pleaſure ſhould make Miniſters, ſhould giue out, and call in agayne, licenſes to preache, ſhould ſuſpende, excommunicate, and doe what he liſt in the church which is the houſe of the liuing God. Of like ſorte are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19103:20"/> with laying on of handes, in ſigne of grace increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: the croſſe in baptiſme, in ſigne of ſeruing like a good ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour of Chriſt: the wearing and bearing in publike admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, of Albe, Surpleſſe, Coape, paſtorall ſtaffe, commonlie called the Croſier ſtaffe. Theſe, and a number of ſuch like, &amp; worſe then ſome of theſe, which ſome laye vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if they be their golde &amp; ſiluer, it may be well ſaid nowe as was ſometime: <hi>The golde of Syon is turned into droſſe, &amp; hir fine ſiluer is like the baſe cure,</hi> which a man being abuſed ſhall laye vp for a time vnder many lockes, and eſteeme it as ſome great treaſure, but after diſcouering th'abuſe, he will caſt awaye in diſpleaſure and indignation with the droſſe of the furnace. The Lorde burne out the droſſe till it be pure, and take away all the baſe mettall, but with the fire of his gracious worde, if it pleaſe him: and not with that the Prophete ſpeaketh of, that the Iudges of Syon may bee reſtored as at the firſt, and their Councellours as in the beginning, and it renowmed for a faithfull Citie, Eſai. 1.25.26.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſuffiſe to haue ſayde to this Section of his Replye. For I leaue his ieſtes and ſcoffes to him ſelfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of, with remembrance that the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>Theſe are thinges not ſeemelie,</hi> and reckoneth this pleaſaunt humour amongſt a number of other things, whereof all profeſſours of the Goſpell, and much more the Preachers of it, ſhoulde bee aſhamed.</p>

            <p>The Replyer to the firſte of theſe places taketh this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is impertinentlie alleadged, and that it toucheth not the queſtion in hande: whereof hee rendreth his reaſon, for that the thinge ſpoken of in that place, is diuerſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither from the matter to bee proued: becauſe the proofe (as hee ſuppoſeth) is to bee made of orders, preſcribed and ſett forth, concerninge eccleſiaſticall gouuernement, for the Churche to bee directed by in all thinges, and the matter whiche the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, is of giftes and functions, the ende whereof is referred to vnitie in doctrine of faith, and to holy and honeſt conuerſation of lyfe, not to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall orders of the Churches Eccleſiaſticall gouernement. This is the effecte of his Replie to this point. Wherein hee hath fayled, in makinge diuerſe thoſe thinges, that are of great agreement togither. For, the purpoſe pretended, is to ſhewe, what that order is, that the holy Scriptures declare, our Sauiour Chriſte to haue appointed for the guydance of his Church. Nowe, to performe this, there is proofe made, of all the Church offices of publique charge, that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of our Sauiour Chriſt, for the directing of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Whiche proofe if it bee ſufficient, as it is, to ſhewe that the Miniſterie of thoſe that are appointed for the preachinge of the worde, both Paſtours, and Teachers, and alſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeruinge for other neceſſarie vſes, that is, both of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ordayned and appointed for the care of honeſt and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie lyfe and manners, and of Deacons, inſtituted for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie and reliefe of the poore and needie, is appointed to bee in the Church: then is all the pollicie and the Diſcipline
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19103:21"/> of the Church ſufficientlie proued. For this being the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of our Sauiour Chriſt, as it is proued by theſe places, that there ſhould be Paſtours, Teachers, Elders, or Gouernors and Deacons in the Churche, the whole Diſcipline of the Church ſtanding in nothing els, but the due calling of them to ſuch charge, and the execution of ſuch dueties, after they be called, as belong therevnto: it is euident, that the whole order which concerneth the externall and outwarde guyding of the Church, is hereby plainlie ſhewed what it is, and that it is ordayned by the Lorde. Where the queſtion were of a king gone to a farre countrey, whether he had left anie certayne forme of policie for the regiment of his kingdome in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, what playner proofe could be made, that hee had lefte certayne order for their gouernement in his abſence then if it could be ſhewed by authentike and ſufficient recordes, vnder his hande and great ſeale, that hee had appointed Magiſtrates for the mannaging of ſtate cauſes, and other, for due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iuſtice amongſt his people. But this doeth the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the proofes alleadged. For, the queſtion being, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Sauiour Chriſt haue ſet anie certayne order for the guyding and directing of his Church till his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming againe: the Declaration anſwereth, that he hath: becauſe he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned Miniſters of the word, Paſtours, and Teachers, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the aduancement of the faith of the Church: Elders for the cenſure of their conuerſation and life, and Deacons for the comfort of the poore and afflicted. Therefore I take it, this allegation is moſt pertinent, and fitteth ſo neare the matter, as the Replier can not by this pretence, nor by anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remoue it. But the cauſe of this errour of his, to take that to be from the matter, that is ſo neare vnto it, ſeemeth to bee, the abuſing of him ſelfe in th'ambiguitie of the word orders. So as where the Declaration vndertaketh to ſhewe a certayne order to be left by our Sauiour Chriſt for th'adminiſtring of all eccleſiaſticall matters, the Replyer belike looketh, here ſhould be ſhewed, ſome orders for things indifferent. For this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19103:21"/> place (ſayeth he) referreth all to vnitie in doctrine of faith, &amp; to holy conuerſation of life, and not to th'externall orders of the Churches eccleſiaſticall gouernement. Whereby he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he looked not to heare proofe of anie matters that are referred to faith or life, but to other externall orders: and what can they be, but of things indifferent. Whiche yet, that they may remayne indifferent, could haue no order appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Sauiour Chriſt, for then ſhould they bee no more indifferent: the commaundement of our Sauior binding to a neceſſarie obedience to doe that which he ſhould command, ſo as this exception can not ſerue. For what orders may more clearely proue, our Sauiour Chriſte to haue taken order for the gouerning of his Church in all eccleſiaſticall matters, then they, which are referred to doctrine and maners. Is there anie matter eccleſiaſticall, that is not referred to one of theſe? And if this place ſhewe th'order he hath ſet, for all things referred either to faith of doctrine or conuerſation of life: ſurely it pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth a certen order for all eccleſiaſticall matters. Which if the Replyer will denie to followe, yet is it to be remembred, that he plainlie confeſſeth here, that the place alleadged, is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to matters of vnitie in doctrine of fayth, and to holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of life. Whereof, whoſoeuer he denie it, I doubt not but euery indifferent and aduiſed Reader will eaſilie diſcerne, that hereby he hath graunted the whole cauſe, except he ſhew ſome eccleſiaſticall matter, that is not referred to one of theſe. Another ſhift he hath, but it is ſuch, as he dareth not truſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſelfe, and yet ſeemeth to point other to vſe it, if they lift. Whiche is, that he ſayeth, th'Apoſtle there ſpeaketh of giftes and functions, meaning, as I thinke, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruing his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of other places, and to his beſt aduantage, that this place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth not anie kindes of offices or charges, but of giftes &amp; fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctions in the Church. For, in his ſpeach, he taketh theſe two wordes for one thing, as after ſhal apeare, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding him ſelfe herein as it ſeemeth vpon that which is ſayde in the ſame place, that Chriſt, being aſcended, gaue giftes vnto men,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19103:22"/> ſome Apoſtles, and ſo forth. But if this miſleade him, he is to vnderſtande, that theſe may wel ſtande togither, that they may be offices, and yet giftes. When a King graunteth a Charter to a people, to be a corporation and a Citie, and ſetteth offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers amongſt them for their good gouernement, are not ſuch offices the Princes giftes, and yet offices too? Wee reade of <hi>Paules</hi> knowledge, wiſedome, diligence in preaching, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for the Goſpell, of his tongues, of his power to worke miracles, and many ſuch like excellent graces, worthie an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Chriſt Ieſus. When the Lord, gaue vs Gentils, ſuch a Teacher, &amp; appointed his name to be brought vnto vs in that veſſell of golde, enriched with ſo many goodlie graces of god, more precious then anie iewell, beſtowed he no gift vpon vs? It is manifeſt that greater giftes haue not bin giuen to men, then were theſe offices whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howe ſoeuer hee point another to it, he did well not to truſt to much to this ſhift him ſelfe. Therefore, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there appeare not anie ſuch order giuen for ceremonies, as, what ſtuffe, what faſhion, what colour, this or that garment ſhould be on, on which ſide of the church the Miniſter ſhould ſtande in his miniſtration, North or South, nor ſuch like: yet, this is manifeſt, euen by the Replyers owne confeſſion, that orders neceſſarie for the church, to vnitie in like precious faith of the ſame holy doctrine and good conuerſation, by, and in obedience to that doctrine, by the miniſterie temporarie of Apoſtles, Prophetes, and Euangeliſtes, and perpetuall, of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Teachers, are eſtabliſhed by our Sauiour Chriſt. To the other place, alleadged by the declaration, which is the 12. of the former epiſt. to the Corinthes, hee taketh the ſame exceptions. Wherein, confeſſing, as he muſt needes, expreſſe mention of gouernours, yet, he would not haue this neither to be to the purpoſe, becauſe (ſayeth hee) here is mencion of Gouernours, but what kinde of gouernours: and whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more gouuernours then the reſt, here mentioned, or by what kinde of gouernement they are to direct the Church, it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19103:22"/> is not ſayde. True it is, for all things are not ſpoken in euerie place: but here appeareth, that there are Gouernours appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Church. Which being ſo, it neceſſarilie followeth, that there is a gouernement left vnto the Church.</p>
            <p>For his ſeconde queſtion, the name of gouernours peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen to theſe, ſheweth that they are rather appointed for gouernement, then the reſt: which being fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, it is plaine, the gouernement muſt be, according to his worde: whiche is aunſwere to another of his queſtions. For his other queſtion, which gouernours are here meant, Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> ſayeth, <hi>By go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, are meant the Elders, who had the charge to ſee this ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall Diſcipline kept and obſerued.</hi> But, to ſatisfie him, not with authoritie but with proofe and reaſon, he is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that, as gouernours are here only named, without further mention of their office, or maner of gouernement, ſo are alſo Apoſtles, Prophetes, Doctors, and other like giftes and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For the purpoſe of the Apoſtle is here, to exhort, to ſuch a vſe of all the giftes and miniſteries and powers beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Church (for all theſe are generallie named in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the chapter) as might moſt further loue, edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and good order in the church: whiche being the purpoſe of the Apoſtle in this place, he was not to ſtande vppon euery ſeuerall gift, miniſterie, and facultie to ſhewe what they were, and to declare whatſoeuer might be ſaide of them. This had bin wholy from the matter he intended, So as, it ſuffiſeth him to name onely the things, to the right vſe whereof hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. For, the things them ſelues were ſufficiently knowen by their names, to thoſe to whom he wrote, and needed no further diſcourſe to make them vnderſtande him. If a letter were directed to a Citie in the behalfe of their Prince, whiche declaring to them, that the offices and powers they haue, the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffes, and ſuch like, they are graunted and giuen them, by free donation and by charter from the Prince, and that therefore they are not to abuſe their places, to the oppreſſing or enuying one of another, but to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19103:23"/> of the ſeruice of their Lorde, and the mutuall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite &amp; ayde one of another, which were the endes, for whiche thoſe priuiledges &amp; honours haue bin beſtowed vpon them: no Man of the citie could doubt at that time, who were meant by the Mayor, Sheriffes, and other Officers named in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, notwithſtanding the office of the Mayor and the reſt were not layd out wherein they ſtoode, and what dueties belonged vnto them, with ſuch like matters, but by their names would eaſilie vnderſtand what offices were meant. But if many yeres after, the gouernement of the citie being altered, and the ſtate of it oppreſſed and tyranniſed by ambitious men, who by ſtill and ſoft motions had cunninglie turned all the courſe of it, ere they were eſpied: the Citizens, in the time of a gracious Prince, ſhould ſue to haue their Charter renewed againe, and alleadge, that they had of auncient time ſuch Officers, A Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yor, Sheriffes, and ſuch like, in their Corporation, prouing it, amongeſt other Recordes, by ſuch a letter, in the Reigne of ſuch a King ſent vnto them: then in deede might grow que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, what offices were noted by thoſe names, and what their gouernement and office had bin in times paſt. Which, being ſo doubted of, could no way more readilie be aunſwered, then by auncient Rolles, Charters and Recordes of that age, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſuch a time, a Mayor lawfullie, by vertue of his office, to haue done ſuch and ſuch things. Whereby it might appeare what maner of office that had bin. This caſe is as like ours here in queſtion of Paſtours, Teachers, Elders and Deacons, as any mans countenance may bee like another. For the Churche, as the Citie of GOD, had offices ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vppon it, which Chriſt IESVS the King thereof, had giuen it, ſoone after his aſcenſion into heauen, at the time of his Coronation, and entringe into the poſſeſſion of his kingdome: whiche offices it enioyed for a ſeaſon, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde was ſubtely oppreſſed and tyranniſed by thoſe, who ſhoulde moſte of all and chieflie haue preſerued the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:19103:23"/>
            <p>But nowe, the Citizens of <hi>Sion</hi> with vs, diſcerninge of the gracious Prince, and tyme, that GOD hath giuen, make their ſute, for renewinge their Charter agayne: and that the offices whiche by our Sauior Chriſte, were of auncient time graunted to the Church, may bee reſtored. In whiche ſute, to ſhewe that ſuch offices were ſometymes in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, wee ſhewe this Recorde of the Apoſtle: who, exhorting all to vſe their giftes and offices, whiche they haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of one GOD, one Lorde, and one Spirite, to the honour of the ſame one Lorde that gaue them, and their owne mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall helpe and comforte, namelie, the giftes and offices whiche had bene beſtowed vppon them. Wherein, we fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gouuernours named, ſhewe it for good euidence, that this was an office and gifte amongeſt the reſte, whiche was graunted to the Church, and therefore praye that wee may haue it reſtored agayne.</p>
            <p>Nowe, to Replye to this, that here is not declared, what theſe Gouernours are in this place mentioned, is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent replye to vs, the euidence beinge full, and ſtronge, for this, that ſometimes the Churche by the gifte of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, had gouernours.</p>
            <p>But whereas it is demaunded, what gouernours theſe were, and what office is noted by this name, wee aunſwere, that the office of Elders is noted by it. For proofe whereof, we ſhewe the monumentes and writinges of that time. Whereby it appeareth, that this name was peculiarlie giuen to thoſe, who are in other places called Elders, to whome, belonged, the power of gouuernement: whereby, in this place, they are noted. This appeareth in the 12. Chapter to the Romanes, where they are called <hi>[proistamenoi,]</hi> that is, ſuche as were ſet ouer the Church, for the guydinge and directing of it: and in the fifte of the former Epiſtle vnto Timothie, they are likewiſe named <hi>[Presbyteroi,]</hi> that is, Elders. To the whiche Elders, togyther with the Miniſters of the worde, (makinge the whole aſſemblie of the Elderſhippe)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19103:24"/> is giuen, that power, that is chiefeſt, and moſt principall in the Church is committed to them, as of impoſing and laying on of handes, vpon ſuch as are ordeyned for the miniſterie of the worde, to binde and to looſe the ſinner, to locke him vppe in the Lordes priſon, or to let him out, and reſtore him into the libertie of the ſonnes of God, as he may be repentaunt or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentant. Thus, this place ſerueth to prooue that, fitlie, which he denieth, that is, the office of Elders, or gouernours in the Church, and beſides, (which the Replier hath taken no heede to) the office of Deacons alſo, who are noted by the name of helpers, as Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> plainlie expoundeth it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by helpers he noteth th'office of Deacons, and as may be ſhewed, by like proofe, as hath bin made of the office of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Thus haue we the whole Diſcipline, proued by theſe places, the firſt, ſhewing the offices of the Miniſterie of the worde Paſtours and Teachers: the other, the reſt of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique charges, that is, Elders and Deacons: In the due voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which offices, &amp; execution of the ſame, the whole pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, order and gouernement of the Church conſiſteth. Which, if anie man can not, or will not ſee, wee are to leaue him, to him, that openeth the eyes of the blinde, and ſhutteth vp theirs, who ſeeinge will not ſee, and ſo proceede to that which followeth.</p>
            <p>After the firſte point of the Diſcipline or pollicie of the Church, which is, that there are appointed of our Sauiour Chriſt, ſome to haue care of others, and to beare publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and charge in the Church, the Declaration addeth this, agreeing alike to all the guydes and ſeruauntes of the church, that, they are to be ordayned, to th'attendance and ſeruice of ſome particular Church, wherein they are to exerciſe and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that office, which they are to be appointed vnto: as cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, cities, or Townes may bee beſt diuided for the purpoſe: Which is proued by theſe two places of Scripture, Act. 14.23. and Titus 1.5. which the Replyer maketh the next ſection. A part of his Replie to it, is ſpent in ſeeking out the meaning of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19103:24"/> the Declaration. Whereof yet, in the ende, by the ſute of the matter, and coherence of the wordes, as he ſayeth, hee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, as he might haue done, if it had pleaſed him, at the firſt, what the Declaration intendeth, and iudgeth rightlie of the meaning of it in parte: but in ſome other goeth as farre from it, as if he were diſpoſed to goe out of his way, when hee might ſee it lye ſtraight before him. For hee gathereth, that ſome of thoſe, who are to haue charge in the Church, ſhould be ſet ouer whole Countries, ſome other ouer Cities, &amp; ſome ouer Townes. Wherein it is not harde to gueſſe what ledde him, in this place, as it doeth in manie other, out of the waye: but, hardlie is he like to finde ſuch a Biſhoprike, or Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike, as he would haue, let him ſeeke it as long as he will in the Declaration: The wordes whereof are very playne to the contrarie. For, it is ſayd, that they all that haue any charge or Miniſterie in the Church, ſhould be diſtributed and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for execution thereof, to certen places or particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. It is added there in deede, that they ſhould be ſo diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, according to the diuiſion of Regions, Cities, &amp; Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but meaning nothing les, then as the Replyer would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſome ſhould be ſet ouer whole countries, as Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and Prouinces. Which appeareth in that it affirmeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlie the contrarie, that is, that they are to ſerue particular Churches or Pariſhes. As for that there is added, according to the diuiſion of Regions, Cities, &amp; Townes, it hath this ſence, that the particular Churches or Pariſhes are to be diuided, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuiſions of Countries, Cities, and Townes, that is, that according as there may be more or fewer particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches in one towne, citie or countrey by a conuenient diſtribution of them, ſo fitte men ſhould bee ordayned to thoſe callings or Miniſteries, more or fewer, as the vſe &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the particular Churches in them ſhould require, til all might be ſufficientlie furniſhed. And, this is it, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſayth, order and neceſſitie requireth. So as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier hath wholy miſtaken his marke, and the matter, in this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19103:25"/> place yet laboureth he to perſuade him ſelf, that he hath fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the right ſenſe by the places quoted for proofe of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Wherein it appeareth, howe hardlie a man ſhall finde way againe, that hath once loſt it. For the 14. of the Actes, he ſayeth confirmeth directlie his ſenſe, but ſheweth no reaſon howe any man but him ſelfe can ſo gather of it, whereas it moſt plainlie teacheth the contrarie, it being there ſaide, that the Elders were ordayned in euerie particular Church, church by Church. Therefore not finding any reaſon to proue his ſenſe, he turneth him ſelfe to another matter, of election and ordination in whoſe power they ſhould be. Whiche, becauſe it belongeth to an other place, where he promiſeth to alledge this proofe againe, I referre the anſwere to the ſame. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example, he ſayeth, doeth moſt apparantlie confirme the ſame his conſtruction, taking holde of that it is ſayde, <hi>Paule left Titus in Creta to ordayne Elders:</hi> for whiche belike hee thought it to be alleadged, which is not ſo, but for the other wordes following, of Elders to be appointed in euery Citie, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by citie. As for the Biſhoprike of <hi>Creta,</hi> or rather Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricke, as he liketh better to terme it after, that he would gather out of this place, and the ſubſcription of that Epiſtle, becauſe it is impertinent to this place, and that he promiſeth not to let this holde of a Biſhopricke or Archbiſhopricke goe thus, but to take better holde of it in another place: I thinke good to let him alone, till he haue taken his ſure holde, that he doe not complayne that he was taken at an aduantage. Thus we haue nothing in this Section, but impertinences &amp; ouerſightes, which are too many and to groſſe, though no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but him ſelfe had looked to this buſines, and none other, had regarded a defence that concerneth the whole Hierarchie and their Iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The next point, ſet downe in the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is, of the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie kindes of Miniſterie, that are in the Church. This, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer diuideth into three Sections: whereof the firſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the number of all ſuch miniſteries, as haue at any time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19103:25"/> bin in the Church of Chriſte, the ſeconde proueth ſome of them to haue bin temporarie and ordayned to continue but for a ſeaſon, and the thirde concludeth, which are perpetuall, and appointed to abide for euer.</p>
            <p>To the firſt parte, the only replie that is made, is, that more offices and giftes then are named in the Declaration, haue bin in the Church. Wherevpon he concludeth nothinge to the preſent matter, but reſteth contented with this, that he haue anie thing, wherein to reproue the declaration. But, what iuſt cauſe of reproofe he hath, may be conſidered by his reaſon. His reaſon is, that the number of giftes and offices, reckoned vp in the Declaration, agreeth not with the texte, wherein there are more named. If this were true, it importeth ſmallie the matter in queſtion, except they be of other ſorte &amp; kinde then theſe are of, which are mentioned. But howe proueth he more? In the 12. to the Romanes, ſayeth he, there are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeauen by the Apoſtle, whereof he rendreth no reaſon in this place, where it had bin fitteſt: but in his Replye to the next ſection, ſheweth howe he would rayſe vp ſixe out of that, wherein he ſeemeth to haue forgotten hee had before recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeauen. Of the ſixe he taketh foure, which the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on noteth, that is, Paſtours, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons: the other two he maketh office, and ſhewer of mercie. But for office, he is to vnderſtande, it is there no name of anie ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall charge, but a generall name, comprehendinge vnder it two ſpeciall kindes of Miniſteries whiche are not Prophetes, that is, Gouernours, and Deacons. For, as Propheſie is in that place the generall name to contayne the two offices of the Miniſterie of the word: ſo is the name of office, or, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle there calleth it Deaconſhippe, a generall, to the other ſpeciall charges, which deale not with the Miniſterie of the worde. So as he might as well haue reckoned propheſie as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or Deaconſhippe, and haue had his whole number of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But, there is no cauſe, for the reaſon I haue ſhewed, why he ſhould alleadge eyther of them both. The other which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19103:26"/> he bringeth in, to make vp his account of ſixe, is of thoſe that ſhewe mercie, who did beare no ſeueral office, but were ſuch of the Deacons, as regarded eſpeciallie thoſe poore ones, that beſide their pouertie, were alſo in ſome affliction, by ſicknes or other like miſerie. Thus can there not bee founde in this place, any more ſpeciall and ſeuerall kindes of offices, then onely the Paſtour, noted by the name of Exhorter, the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, the Elder, called Gouernour or Ouerſeer, and Deacon termed Diſtributor. The next place, alleadged for the proofe of theſe offices ſet downe in the Declaration, is, 1. Corint. 12. verſ. 28. Wherein, becauſe he findeth not, beſides the other, named in the other places, quoted in the Declaration, but onely three, which are there alſo mentioned, that is, the giftes of healing, of powers or miracles, and of tongues, hee ſayeth, that beginning at the 8. verſe of that chapter, hee findeth nine more which were not before named in the 12. to the Roman. and in the 1. Cor. 12.28. two or three, not before mencioned, and in the 4. to the Epheſians, 4. or 5. more, and ſo ſayeth he there are more, then as many more agayne as are reckoned in the Declaration to bee founde, euen in theſe places: beſides thoſe that are mentioned in the other. In which Replye hee did warilie not to name them, as he did in the 12. to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, which he taketh to be mencioned by the Apoſtle, and pretermitted in the Declaration. For them hee might ſoone haue bin aunſwered, as he hath bin of the other: that eyther he miſtaketh generalls for ſpecials, or maketh a difference of ſundrie kindes of offices where none is. Nowe therefore, till he ſhewe what they are, this may ſuffiſe him for anſwere.</p>
            <p>In the next Section the Declaration hauing alreadie ſayde, that the giftes &amp; offices giuen to the church were theſe, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophetes, Euangeliſtes, giftes of healing, of miracles, of tongues, Paſtours, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ſhewe which of theſe were temporarie, and giuen but for to continue a certayne time: and whiche were perpetuall, to remayne for euer. Of the former ſorte are ſhewed to haue
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19103:26"/> bin the ſixe here firſt named, which is proued by the ceaſinge of the giftes, and the vſe of thoſe offices: both which ceaſing manifeſtlie declare, that ſuch offices were but to continue by the ordinance of God for a ceaſon. Theſe are the generall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which in the handling of the particulars are inforced by ſundrie other proofes, agreeing to the ſpeciall offices of the Apoſtles, Euangeliſtes, and the reſt. The firſt matter he excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt here, is, that ſuch offices and giftes as haue bin ſaide to be but temporarie, and to haue ceaſſed ſince the time of the primitiue Church, were not ſuch, neyther haue ceaſſed, but haue bin ſince that time, and ſome (ſayeth he, returninge to this point againe, after he had left it) are yet remayning. For inſtance of that he ſpeaketh of here in this place, hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth power to worke miracles, which diuers (ſayeth hee) of the papiſtes had: he nameth alſo the gift of ſpeaking ſtrange tongues, without ſtudie, which one Anthonie (he ſaieth) was indued with, &amp;c. Of prophecie whiche diuers had amongeſt the Fathers, the Papiſtes and vs, which is much more true, of the gift of healing. For anſwere to this (I ſay) he needed to haue ſhewed good authoritie for theſe matters, our credulitie being not ſo great, as vpon his bare worde, to beleeue matters ſo ſtraunge, and almoſt incredible. But I ſuppoſe he thought he ſhould bring ſmall credit and honour to his proofe, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging his Authours. For, what other Authour coulde hee name vs, for popiſh miracles, but the lying Legende, as it is commonly and truely named, A booke (as one worthily ſaide of it) whoſe authour was of an yron face, and a leaden harte, that is, a fooliſh and an impudent man. And for the reſt, what other authour but eyther the ſame, or ſome at leaſt, in ſome pointes, as fabulous, and of as little trueth as that, except per aduenture of the gift of prophecie, he may ſhewe ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie example or two, which toucheth not the poynt han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is, that theſe giftes were neither ordinarie nor perpetuall. His ſeconde obiection to this parte is, that there were more giftes in the primitiue Church, then
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19103:27"/> are named in the Declaration: a matter which he hath bin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to proue before, and nowe returneth vnto agayne, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che yet if he could proue, might peraduenture ſhewe, that there are more giftes ceaſed, then are mentioned in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but that there are anie more perpetuall, then are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by it, or that anie of thoſe are ceaſed, whiche are there ſayde to remayne for euer, it proueth not. But let vs ſee, howe he proueth this: In the 12. to the Romanes (ſayeth he) there are two more named, that is, office and ſhewing of mercie, this hath bin aunſwered alreadie before. Further in the 1. Corin. the 12. Chap. he mooueth many queſtions to little purpoſe. For aunſwere to all which he is to vnderſtande, that th'Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mentioneth not anie giftes here, that are peculiar giftes, whereof the queſtion is, but ſuch as eyther are named agayne in the 28. verſe, or are conteyned vnder ſome of them, or of the ſame ſorte and kinde that they are of. So the gift of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſedome, though nowe giuen by ordinarie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſtudie, is that, whiche belongeth to the Paſtours and Teachers, whoſe office being perpetuall, the gifte alſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth. Faith is not anie peculiar gifte, but common to all the Church, and therefore not to this queſtion: The gift of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles is named in the other place, ſo is prophecie &amp; tongues, which here as a general contayneth alſo vnder it the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them here mentioned, as the power of miracles doth the gift of diſcerning ſpirites: which may ſatisfie him for this matter of the offices, which haue ceaſſed, and haue no further vſe in the Church. Whereof, hee confeſſing ſome reaſon to haue bin rendred by the Declaration, demaundeth, what is alleadged, for the perpetuitie of thoſe, that are ſayd to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: none, ſayeth he but this, that eyther they are temporarie, or perpetuall, but not temporarie, therefore perpetuall. Whiche reaſon, hee graunteth to be good, if the partes were good, meaning, as it ſeemeth, that, that ſentence, wherein it is ſayde, they are not temporarie, wanteth proofe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he might eaſilie diſcerne the proofe, ſeeing it was ſayde,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19103:27"/> that the temporarie ceaſſed, becauſe the giftes neceſſarie for the execution of them is ceaſſed, and for that the vſe of them is gone. If then, there bee perpetuall and neceſſarie vſe of theſe offices in the Church, and that, the giftes whereby men may bee inabled, for the due performance of ſuch charges, doe yet, and ſhall ſtill continue: then it is playne, that theſe and theis onely, of all the offices, giuen at anie time to the Churche, are perpetuall, and to remayne for euer. But it is true, that the vſe of all and euerie one of theſe foure offices is neceſſarie for the Church, and the giftes are yet giuen by ordinarie meanes, whereby men may be inabled for them, which is not ſo any other. Therefore theſe, and theſe onely are perpetuall. The neceſſarie vſe of the moſt of theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I thinke, I ſhall not neede to labour much to prooue. For it is manifeſt, and as I take it, without queſtion betweene vs, that the callinge of Paſtoures is neceſſarie, as without whiche, the Church is as a flocke of ſheepe without a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde. Whiche, if it were denied, might bee proued by the dueties of his callinge, and the indiſpoſition of men to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, through the corruption of nature. For men beinge ſtubburne and diſobedient by nature, are to bee feared with the terrour of Gods heauie iudgement, threatned to ſinners, that they may yeelde obedience vnto his holy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We are ſlowe to euery thing that is good, euen after we haue receyued ſome meaſure of grace: and therefore need ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to ſtirre vs vp to a cherefulnes and readines to doe the will of God. In afflictions we are often caſt downe aboue meaſure: and therefore neede the comfort and conſolation of the Scriptures, to giue vs hope. The ſame may be ſaide, of an infinite number of other our infirmities, according to the condition and qualitie, whereof we neede to haue the word of GOD applyed vnto vs. Which application belonging to the Paſtours duetie, it is playne, there is moſt neceſſarie vſe of his office and ſeruice in all ages, and therefore perpetuall, and to continue for euer.</p>

            <p>The adminiſtration of the Sacramentes being the ordinance of God, and a duetie which the Paſtour is charged with, doeth in like maner declare, that office to bee moſt neceſſarie. But, this I thinke will not be denied. Of the Teachers office, there is more queſtion made: yet the Replyer, howſoeuer at ſome other times, he affirme the contrarie, in the 62. page of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, ſayeth expreſlie, Teachers are alwayes neceſſarie for the inſtruction of doctrine and documentes of life. And agayne, in the page 67. graunteth perpetuitie of teaching. But, if he will conſtrue his meaning to bee in theſe wordes, <hi>not,</hi> of that particular office that we affirme, which ſtandeth in doctrine, but generallie of the Miniſterie, and of the Paſtours office: yet is it to be noted, that he graunteth, enforced by the cleare trueth thereof, that the teaching of doctrine, and documents of life, is neceſſarie. But this is the ſpeciall office that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle declareth, to belong to the Teacher. Moreouer, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of teaching is to be argued, by the ignorance which is naturall in vs. For the remedie and helpe whereof there is neede of a Teacher, who may eſpeciallie regarde, the bringing of the people to the true knowledge of God, and the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his will. Which ignorance, wherein all men are borne, being in daunger to be increaſed, by ſundrie meanes, which may drawe men from heauenly wiſedome, yea though hir meſſengers ceaſe not to call in the higheſt ſtretes &amp; places of the Citie, as by the cares and pleaſures of this life: likewiſe alſo by the deceytes of erroures, through the manifolde prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of Sathan, and his inſtrumentes, and by many other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: the neceſſitie hereof is the more playne and euident. For, ſo long as men are ſubiect, to theſe things, it muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that they can not be, without fit meanes, for the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hereof: or, that the Churche is miſerablie deſtituted, if it want helpes, which are needfull.</p>
            <p>Nowe the giftes, needfull for eyther of theſe callinges, are the worde, or ſpeache of wiſedome and knowledge, as th'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle nameth them, which experience teacheth, to be giuen
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19103:29"/> by ordinarie meanes. Therefore, the neceſſitie and perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of theſe two miniſteries, beſides the authorities of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, whereon they are grounded, is to bee acknowledged, for the reaſons mentioned. The neceſſitie of the Deacons likewiſe appeareth in that it is ſayd: <hi>You ſhall haue alwayes the poore with you.</hi> For, the inſtitution of Deacons, being for the comfort and ſuccour of the poore, and ſuch as are in miſerie, ſo long, as there continewe ſuch in the Church, which wilbe to the ende of the worlde: There muſt needes be, vſe of the helpe, and ſeruice, of the Deacons, who may relieuet hem. But, of this publique Miniſterie and charge, the neceſſitie and perpetuitie of it, the Replyer ſeemeth to make no great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or rather to confeſſe it. The great queſtion is, of the Elders, concerning whom it is to be conſidered, that they are appointed in their ſpeciall charge, to keepe good watche ouer the life and conuerſation of the people: to ſee what fruite they yeelde of the teachinge, exhortations, and ſuch like dueties which are done to them, by the Miniſters of the worde: to the ende, that they being well inſtructed, of the proceeding, ſtaye, or ſlyding backe of anie, may the more fitlie applye them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and their labours, for their inſtruction and ſtirring vp, to goe forwardes in the wayes of the Lorde. Likewiſe alſo they are to vnderſtande, what offences ariſe in the Congregation, that order may be taken for them, as appertayneth, Theſe, &amp; ſuch like dueties, are incident into the charge of the Elders, as may appeare by the places, where mention is made of them, and namelie by the 12. to the Romanes, and the 5. of the firſt epiſtle to Timothie, wherein being termed Elders, and Ouer-ſeers, or Gouernours, and expreſlie ſhutte out from the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the worde: it appeareth, their charge ſtandeth in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life and conuerſation: there being no other thing but doctrine or life, whereof there ſhould be Ouer-ſeers or Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours.</p>
            <p>Nowe, as they haue theſe dueties, eſpeciallie lying vppon them, ſo, as neceſſarie partes of the Seniorie or Elderſhippe,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19103:30"/> they haue power, to deale in the chiefeſt matters, belonging to the Church: as, in the cenſures, and in the calling of the Miniſters of the worde, and in making conſtitutions and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders meete for the Church whereof they are Elders: whiche dueties are ſhewed to belong vnto them, both by auncient preſidentes of th'Elders, that were of the Sinagogues of the Iewes, and by expreſſe places of the newe Teſtament, where, theſe things are attributed vnto them: namelie in the 18. of Mat. the 15. of the Actes, and the 4. of the ſecond epiſtle vnto Tim. Whiche being ſo, the neceſſitie of this calling in the Church, muſt needes be exceeding great. For otherwiſe, what ſhall become of theſe dueties, which are ſo neceſſarie in the Church: it being not lawfull to haue them done, by anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then ſuch as God hath appointed for that purpoſe. Thus the neceſſitie and perpetuitie of theſe offices, doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. But, if this doe not ſuffice, let him looke vpon the 28. of the Goſpell, written by the Euangeliſt Matthewe, and the 6. of the former Epiſt. to Tim. In the former of theſe two places, it is thus written, 18.19. and 20. verſ. <hi>Ieſus came and ſpake vnto them, ſaying, All power is giuen me in heauen and in earth: goe therefore, and teache all Nations baptizing them in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. Teachinge them to obſerue all things what ſoeuer I haue commaunded you, and loe, I am with you alway vnto the ende of the world, Amen.</hi> Wherein the time when our Sauiour ſpake this, is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: which was, after his reſurrection, and vpon his aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into heauen, after he had 40. dayes long, as it is written in the firſt of the Actes, inſtructed his Diſciples of ſuch thinges, as concerned his kingdome. Whereinto it can not be denied, but the whole pollicie and Diſcipline of the Church belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, conteyning the lawes and ſtatutes of our Sauiour, for the calling of any, to charge, in his Church, and, the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſame. For as the lawes of a kingdome, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the officers of the Crowne, and all other inferior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, with declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the order of their calling, the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19103:30"/> of their places, and the maner of proceedinge, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the ſame, can not be denied, to belong, to the ſtate of that kingdome: no more can the Diſcipline be ſayde, not to pertayne to the ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt. Otherwiſe, the greateſt, and moſt weightie matters that are done by his authoritie, ſhalbe ſayde, not to belong to his kingdome: as, to appoint and execute publique charges, to cenſure, to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and ſuch like. In a temporall and earthlie king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it would be an abſurd thing, in the iudgement of all men of vnderſtanding, to ſaye, the appointing of Magiſtrates, their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, the boundes &amp; limitations of their power, their order to proceede by, to the caſting of ſubiectes into priſon, &amp; the putting of them to death: did nothing belong to the ſtate of a kingdome, whereas in deede, theſe are principall effectes of the power and authoritie of the King, and moſt naturallie, and eſſentiallie belonging to the ſtate of his kingdome. So can it not be leſſe abſurde, to denie the like, to pertayne to the power and kingdome of our Sauiour Chriſt. For the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the worde, the Elders appointed for ouerſight, and the Deacons for the poore, are the officers whiche our Sauiour Chriſt hath ordeyned, to guyde the Church vnder his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the cenſures are the puniſhementes of his diſobedient ſubiectes, ſeparation from the Lordes table, as commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of his preſence to warde, excommunication as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death. Wherefore, it muſt needes be, that the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the number, and kindes of publike charges in the Church, the limiting of their power, the order, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to ſeparation from the Lords table, and to excommu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nication, muſt needes be, things belonging to the kingdome of our Sauior Chriſt. Which being (as I thinke it muſt needs be) confeſſed, then it followeth, that our Sauiour Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe 40. dayes, next before his aſcenſion into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as the Euangeliſt Luke ſayeth, he inſtructed his Diſciples, of thoſe things, that belong to his kingdome, informed them what publike functions he appointed for the gouernance of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19103:31"/> the Church, how many, and of what power euery one ſhould be, and in what order, and vpon what cauſes, they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to excommunication, and the other cenſures. Whiche graunted, as in any ſounde iudgement it can not bee denied, then conſequentlie theſe are alſo of the things which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt commaunded the Apoſtles, to teache ſuch to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, as they ſhould make Diſciples. Further, it may appeare, that our Sauiour Chriſt, in theſe wordes, teache them, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all things, which I haue commaunded you, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo the policie of the Church, by the order of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, here mentioned by the Euangeliſt. For, it is ſayde, that our Sauiour firſt ſpeaking of his fulnes of power, whiche hee had giuen him in heauen and earth, to aſſure them, that hee had authoritie to commaunde them, to doe theſe things, and abilitie to aſſiſte and proſper them, in ſo doing: Firſte, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, to preache the worde, then, to miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes (for that is expreſlie ſaide of the one, is of like to bee gathered of the other in this reſpect) and in the ende, to teach the Diſciples to obſerue all things, that he had commaunded. Which tenor and courſe of ſpeache, ſheweth, that he ſpake to them, of the Diſcipline. For, beſides the miniſterie of the worde, and of the Sacramentes, what other thinges are there belonging to the kingdome of Chriſt, but the Diſcipline. This being then thus ſufficientlie proued, that the Diſcipline of the Church, is a part, at the leaſt, of thoſe things, which our Sauiour Chriſt, in this place, is ſaide to haue commaunded his Apoſtles to teache their Diſciples, to obſerue: I proceede further, to ſhewe the perpetuitie of theſe foreſaide publique charges of the Church, which is the thing I haue in hande. The Euangeliſt ſayeth, that our Sauiour added to his former charge and commaundement, a moſt comfortable promiſe, ſaying, <hi>Beholde I am with you alwayes, to the finiſhinge of the worlde.</hi> Which wordes can not be vnderſtood, of the Apoſtles onely, becauſe they, as it is ſaide of <hi>Dauid,</hi> after they had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their tyme, they died. Whereby it is of neceſſitie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19103:31"/> that our Sauiour promiſeth, to bee with them, for their time, &amp; after alſo with ſuch, as by their doctrine ſhould be his Diſciples, to the ende of the worlde. Nowe, to bee with them is a promiſe of proſpering, and bleſſing to his Church, the miniſterie of ſuch holy thinges, as hee had commaunded them, to teache the Diſciples to obſerue. Which may appeare by the Euangeliſt Marke, who declaring the performance of this promiſe to the Apoſtles, ſayeth, <hi>That they went and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the Lord working with them, and confirming the worde by ſignes that followed.</hi> The meaning therefore of the promiſe is, that the Lord would bleſſe the Miniſterie of the worde, th'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacramentes, and the obſeruation of the Diſcipline which hee had deliuered them to the good of his church, in their handes for their time, in ſuch ſort, as the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of their Apoſtolicall calling did require, in extraordinarie giftes and aſſiſtance: and after, in the handes of ſuch, as ſhould be apointed for the ordinarie ſeruice of his people, according as their ordinarie functions ſhould neede, euen to the ende of the world. Which can not be, if the offices he appointed, were but temporarie, and not perpetuall. Therefore, I conclude, that the miniſterie of the worde by Paſtours and Teachers, the ouerſight of the church, by Elders, th'attendance of the poore by Deacons, being the neceſſarie and ordinarie functions and offices which our Sauiour hath inſtituted and ordained in his Church, and hauing promiſe of bleſſing from the Lorde in their due adminiſtration to the ende of the worlde, they are alſo perpetuall, and to continue for euer: which may bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo confirmed in that our Sauior, in the 18. of Matthewe declareth the effect of this promiſe to belong particularlie, to the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Diſcipline. For there our Sauiour appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a proceeding for the remedie of offences, ſayeth: <hi>And if he refuſe to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: and if he refuſe to heare the Church alſo, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man and as a publicane. Verilie I ſay vnto you, Whatſoeuer ye binde on earth, ſhalbe bounde in heauen: and whatſoeuer yee looſe on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19103:32"/> earth, ſhalbe looſed in heauen.</hi> Agayne, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erilie I ſaye vnto you, that if two of you ſhall agree in earth vppon anie thing, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſhall deſire, it ſhalbe giuen them of my Father which is in heauen. For where two or three are gathered togither in my Name, there am I in the middes of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereby, as it is manifeſt that the execution &amp; Diſcipline is of the things which our Sauiour hath commaunded, who ſaieth expreſlie, <hi>tell the Church,</hi> ſo is it plaine, to be within this promiſe, of his preſence &amp; aſſiſtance, directlie promiſing, that when they ſhall meete togither in his name, that is, by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, for ſuch purpoſe, and call vpon him, he wilbe in the middeſt of them, &amp; authorize their due proceedings: binding and looſing in heauen, that which vpon earth they ſhall ſo do, according to his appointment. Moreouer, for further proofe of the perpetuitie of theſe foreſaide publike functions in the Church, it is playne, that the Apoſtle writing to Timothy, to teache him howe to behaue him ſelfe in the Church, which is the houſe of the liuing God: inſtructeth him, of all theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is, of the Miniſters of the worde, both Paſtours &amp; Tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers, and of the Elders and Deacons. For the Miniſters of the worde, it is cleare, in that he requireth in euery one to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that miniſterie an abilitie to teache, which is, as hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it to <hi>Titus,</hi> to deliuer ſound, that is holy &amp; true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. That both kindes of Miniſters are heere to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, may appeare by this, that the Apoſtles rules there, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of all the Miniſters of the worde, as his indifinite ſpeach in a generall matter declareth. But Paſtours and Teachers alſo are the ordinarie officers appointed for the miniſterie of the worde, to the Church, as appeareth by the 12. to the Roman. Therefore, both Paſtours &amp; Teachers are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended there, by the Apoſtle. Further, it will not bee denied, but that this ſpeach in the 1. to Tit. is of the ſame miniſters, which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of here, but there he noteth both kindes, as it may apeare by mention of exhortation, the ſpecial propertie of the Paſtor, &amp; of conuictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a peculiar part of th'office of the Teacher: ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in the place mentioned to Tim. both kindes of Miniſters
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19103:32"/> of the word, Paſtors &amp; Teachers are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended. That in the other name of Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they are included, whoſe ſpecial name this is in the church, I think it is not doubted. Now that elders are there alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by that name, thus I proue: The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders office is an ordinary office in the Church, as appeareth in the 12. to the Rom, &amp; in the 5. of this epiſt. where it is playnlie noted, that there are Elders (which name particularly is neuer giuen to ſuch as by their proper name are called Deacons) for direction of the Church, who deale not with the Miniſterie of the word, as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, but only with the ouerſight of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation. If it be ſo, then in an inſtruction whiche th'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would giue to Timothy, how to behaue him ſelfe in all matters of charge in the church, they can not be pretermitted. But they can not be here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined vnder the name of Biſhops, becauſe teaching is required of them, which belongeth not to the Elders, as is declared in the 5. chap. following. Therefore it muſt needes be they are to be vnderſtood vnder the name of Deacons. Moreouer in ſo generall an inſtruction for ordering the houſe of God, it is to be confeſſed that in theſe two names of Biſhops &amp; Deacons, the Apoſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth al the offices of the church as in the 1. to the Phil. ver. 1. <hi>Paul and Timothy the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt to all the Saints, in Chriſt Jeſus whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are at Philippi, with the Biſhops &amp; Deacons:</hi> and in the 12. to the Rom: But he conteyneth not Elders vnder Biſhops, for the reaſon alleadged therfore vnder Deacons: And to make all playne, in the 12. to the Rom. the Apoſtle conteyning all the functions vnder Prophets &amp; Deacons, diuideth Prophets into exhorters &amp; teachers, and Deacons into Elders &amp; diſtributers: expreſlie noting, when the name of Deacon is oppoſed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other name, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyning the Miniſters of the word, and is taken generally for all the offices, not dealing with the Miniſtery of the word, that th'elders are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned vnder this name. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, in the 5. cha. of this epiſt. he maketh mention of Elders that haue ouerſight ouer the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, both in things that concerne the worde, and alſo of other thinges beſides the worde, whiche muſt needes bee of conuerſation and lyfe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19103:33"/> there being nothing but theſe two, doctrine, and life, whereof generall direction and care ſhould bee taken. Being then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie named by the Apoſtle in the aforeſaide 5. Chapter, as one kinde of publike charge in the Church, it can not be, that the Apoſtle forgot, or pretermitted this kinde in the third go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, where he giueth rules for the qualifications, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in euery one that ſhould be called to publique charge in the Church. But in the name of Biſhopps they can not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, for the propertie of teaching required in them, which is not ſo in the Elders, as it is in the 5. chapter: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are comprehended vnder the general name of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. Howſoeuer it be, yet can it not be denied, that Elders are named in the 5. chap. as a kinde of publike charge in the Church.</p>
            <p>Nowe I adde, that the inſtructions whiche the Apoſtle had giuen to Timothy, concerning the miniſterie of the worde, both Paſtours and Teachers, vnder the name of Biſhops, and concerning Elders and Deacons, partly vnder the name of Deacon, common to them both, &amp; particularly by the name of Elder, touching ſuch as are ſo ſpeciallie called, are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and to be followed, &amp; kept without default in any part, to the glorious comming againe of Chriſt to iudgement. For proofe whereof, I rehearſe the very wordes of the Apoſtle: <hi>I charge thee in the ſight of God who quickeneth all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.13.14.15.16.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ieſus Christ, which vnder Pontius Pilate profeſſed a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie profeſſion, That thou keepe theſe commaundements without ſpot and vnrebukeable, vntill the appearing of our Lord</hi> JESVS <hi>Christ. Which in due time he ſhall ſhewe, that is bleſſed and Prince onely the King of Kings, and Lord of Lordes, who onely hath immortalitie and dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto, whom neuer man ſawe, vnto whom be honor and power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ignorant what exceptions are taken to this place, but the anſwere to them, cleareth all ſuch doubtes. So as I doubt not but the indifferent Reader, conſideringe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:19103:33"/> on all partes, will finde, that this ſo earneſt charge and obteſtation is to be extended to all the pointes of that Epiſtle. Eſpeciallie concerning the ordering of the Church. For whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ende, as the Apoſtle plainlie declareth, that he wrote it, ſo hauing finiſhed his inſtructions concerning that matter, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them vp with ſuch a ſeale, as declareth, that hee, whiche ſhall offende againſt them, ſhall ſinne againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord of life, &amp; againſt the example of the lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, both whoſe vengeance &amp; puniſhment, he is to feare, at the glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the lord againe to iudgement. And again, if any man for the duetiful keeping of thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes ſhall ſuffer, yea though it be to death, he is to be aſſured, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue his life againe of the Commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of theſe things, who quickeneth the dead, and following the example of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie profeſſion made by our Sauiour Chriſt, is to receyue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie and honour for euer, at his glorious appearinge, which ſhalbe as certainlie performed, as he (in whoſe name theſe things are denounced and promiſed) is the bleſſed and onely Prince, King of Kings, Lorde of Lordes, onely immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, to whom belongeth honour and ſtrength euerlaſting, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Thus the perpetuitie of theſe offices is proued by theſe reaſons and authorities: I would to God, the neceſſarie &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall vſe of them, were not alſo manifeſt, by the wofull and lamentable experience of ſuch Churches, as doe want them: according as their wantes are, eyther of all, or of ſome, in part or altogither. Of the ignorance of the people, in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning godlines and religion, what other cauſe can be aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, but that they wante godly learned Miniſters of the worde amongſt them. Teachers to inſtruct them in ſounde &amp; holy doctrine, and Paſtours to exhort them according to it. If it be, life euerlaſting to knowe the onely true God,<note place="margin">Iohn 17.3.</note> &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath ſent Chriſt IESVS, and, if the wante of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God be damnable, as it is ſayde, That the ſeruaunt not knowing his Maiſters will,<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> and therefore not dooing it ſhalbe beaten: and againe, That the Lord when he ſhal come
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19103:34"/> with his mightie Angells, in flaming fire, ſhall puniſhe thoſe, who haue not knowen God: ſurelie then, the meanes whiche God (who would haue all men ſaued and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth) hath appointed for that purpoſe:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.4.</note> is moſte needefull to continue, both for the honour of GOD, and the ſaluation of the people. Whiche meanes, being the offices of Paſtours and Teachers, nothing can be more neceſſarie, then th'eſtabliſhing of them in all places, and continuing of the ſame ſucceſſiuelie to the ende of the worlde. The ſame is to be ſaide of th'other offices. All manner of offences are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and remayne without redreſſe, at the leaſt without redreſſe ſufficient, and ſuch as God hath appointed, to the infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God and diſedification of the Church where there are not Elders, nor Ouerſeers, that in conſcience, of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ordinance of God, may looke vnto it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the poore, can not by anie, neuer ſo wiſe, and politicke lawes of men be prouided for, where the Deacons, Fathers, &amp; Tutours of the poore, appointed of God, in conſcience of his commaundement, and their moſt bounden duetie to him, attende not vpon the poore. Whiche apparauntlie teſtifieth, the neceſſarie and perpetuall vſe of them. Therefore, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, I ſaye, th'ignorance, the offences, in euerie ſorte moſt lamentable to beholde, Atheiſme, profanenes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, blaſphemie, horrible othes, not farre blaſphemie, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, yea contempt of the Sabboth day, the diſhonour of all to whom honour is due, the murders, adulteries, robberies, periuries, the ſwarmes of rogues and beggers, their dying in the fieldes vnder hedges, and in Townes and Cities, at the dores, crye with a loude voyce vnto God, and all lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnder him, that for wante of the preachinge of the worde, they periſhe, for lacke of it they dye in their ignorance and diuers ſinnes, for default of the meanes that ſhould bring them to the knowledge of God and to repentance, default I ſaye both of the worde taught and preached, and ſpiritual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, yea their ſoules and their bodyes are deſtroyed, for
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19103:34"/> wante of the meanes, which God hath ordayned for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort of them both. Whoſe crie the Lorde in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie heare in his good time, and giue to the higher powers alſo to heare it, and to take ſuch order for it, as may be moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto him, and moſt comfortable to his people.</p>
            <p>Thus farre haue I laboured to ſhewe, the neceſſarie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall vſe of the offices of the Miniſters of the worde, both Paſtours and Teachers, of Elders alſo and of Deacons. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I would ende the aunſwere to this ſection, but that heere is offred an occaſion to ſpeake a worde or twoo more, to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter in it.</p>
            <p>The Declaration ſhewing, that God withdrawing th'extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie giftes of healing, and ſuch like, hath withall ſhewed that the offices depending vpon thoſe giftes, ſhould ceaſe: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh it as a vanitie in the papiſtes to keepe ſtill, Exorciſtes and extreeme Vnction, and to ſpeake with ſtraunge tongues, which they haue not by inſpiration, and that without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which is expreſlie forbidden. The Replyer, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting paſſe the rebuke, for the two former pointes, for the third ſayeth he, belie not the Diuell. Their fault was not, that they ſpake with ſtraunge tongues, which they had not by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for if they had not had them by inſpiration, and yet had they vnderſtoode them, and the people alſo, then had this bin no fault, except in ſpeaking faultie matter. Theſe are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyers wordes: wherein he hath little cauſe to vſe this homely prouerbe againſt the Declaration. For it reporteth not vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of them, but chargeth them with vanitie, for doing that, which they doe in deede. So as, if there be anie fault here, it is not in ſpeaking vntruely of them, but, in making that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is truelie ſayde they doe, to be a fault which is none. But this was onely a quarell picked to mainteyne ſpeaking of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin in the pulpit, which the Replyer thought to be a litle tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, in that the Papiſtes are charged with vanitie for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with tongues, whiche they had not by inſpiration. Which if it be, for that cauſe a vanitie in them, then the replier
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19103:35"/> thought, it would be gathered, to be as vayne a thing in anie other, that hauing not the gifte by inſpiration no more then they, but onely by ſtudie and ordinarie meanes, yet doe vſe, to vtter ſentences in Latine and other tongues: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in Latin, for it is not euery mans gift to vnderſtand greeke and Hebrewe, which he had good reaſon in deede to ſuppoſe. But howe doeth he anſwere the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which reſteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this reſon, why it ſhould be a vanitie in them, namely, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue that tongue by ſtudie and not by inſpiration. Which is, as if it had bin more at large ſaide, that being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie gift, there might be yet ſome vſe for the miracle, to giue credite and doe honour to that doctrine, which ſuch a beleeuer did profeſſe: but for a man that had bin trayned vp in ſchoole all his life, and had ſpent many yeares in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, to ſpeake Latine in his ſermon, as if it were a miracle for a man, in twentie or thirtie yeares ſo beſtowed, to ſpeake of him ſelfe, or repeate out of other, a fewe ſentences in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: could haue no ſuch grace, nor vſe, no nor any good vſe, but onely ſheweth the vanitie and follie of the partie that ſo ſpeaketh. To this reaſon he maketh no aunſwere, but onely ſayeth, it was no fault in them, (although they had them not by inſpiration, if both they and the people vnderſtoode them) to ſpeake with ſtraunge tongues. But it is not ynough for him to ſaye ſo, with a bare worde, he had neede to haue ſhewed, ſome good reaſon, to mainteyne it, the argument of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration being ſo ſtrong to the contrarie as it is. Hee coulde not alſo be ignorant, that th'Apoſtle reproueth this oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe of Corinth, who yet had it by extraordinarie gift, as a childiſhe follie in them, ſaying: <hi>Brethren, be not children in vnderstanding:</hi> howe much more then is it worthie of that reproofe in ſuch,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.20</note> as haue it not by that meanes. In the ſame place th'Apoſtle noteth out of the Prophete, that it was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.21 Eſai 28.11.</note> threatned from God, to ſpeake to men in a ſtrange tongue: ſo litle cauſe they had to glorie in that abuſe. After alſo he ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Co. 14.22.</note> that the vſe of tongues, was to the infidell &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19103:35"/> as by the miracle, to worke in him ſome ſence and reuerence of the doctrine ſo authoriſed, but not (ſayeth he) to the beleeuer, for whom prophecie, that is expoſition of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures, in a tounge vnderſtoode of all is appointed. In the Church therefore it is impertinent to ſpeake with ſtrange tongue. <hi>I ſpeake tongues</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle in the ſame place) <hi>more then all you doe, yet had I rather speake in the Church fiue wordes to instruct other with them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.18.19.</note> 
               <hi>then a thouſande in a ſtrange tongue.</hi> Wherein the modeſtie of the Apoſtle, and his care of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of the Church appeareth. To which purpoſe alſo, he ſayeth in another place, <hi>That he regarded not to bee esteemed to knowe any thing amongst them, but Ieſus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.1.2</note> 
               <hi>and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> The contrarie therefore is, not to ſeeke (as a man ought to doe) the honour onely of Chriſt, and the edification of his Church, but ſauoureth of fleſhe and blood. For as it is well obſerued by Maiſter <hi>Caluin,</hi> of worthie memorie, the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les voluntarie abſteyning from ſpeaking with tongues,<note place="margin">Caluin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta. in 1. Cor. 14.19</note> who could haue triumphed herein ouer them all, and his ſeeking to edifie the Church without all maner of pompe, conuinceth their ſwelling ambition who affect the ſhewing of them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: whoſe authoritie, ought to drawe them from vanitie. In like maner ought the perpetuall and conſtant examples of all the Prophetes, of whom diuers, as it appeareth, had skill of ſundrie languages, and of all the Apoſtles, who excelled all others herein. Of all which not one appeareth, at any time, to haue ſpoken, in his publique miniſterie, in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with anie other tongue, then the vulgar tongue of the people. No more did our Sauiour him ſelfe, whoſe perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all example in this, concerning their Miniſterie, ought to bee a rule to all thoſe, who with modeſtie ſeeke th'edification of the Church. It may be added alſo herein, that the Fathers vſe it not, nor the reformed Churches of this age: therefore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not bin ſo done by the Prophetes, nor by the Apoſtles, nor by other in the primitiue Church, nor by the Fathers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, nor vſed by the beſt reformed Churches: It were to be wiſhed, that they, in whoſe fauor the Replier maketh this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19103:36"/> would rather conforme them ſelues to the examples of all thoſe, then to the Church of Rome, where almoſt only this oſtentation is vſed.</p>
            <p>That part in the declaration which is made the next ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the concluſion, inferred of the former reaſon, that only Paſtours, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons remayne and are to continue to the ende, all other offices being ceaſed, whiche were of ſpeciall vſe, for a certaine tyme, and of extraordinarie giftes for performance of them. Wherevpon is inferred, that it is needles, and vnlawfull, to inſtitute anewe any other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries or charges in the Church, beſide the aforeſayde offices, which are reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by the inſtitution of God, &amp; the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe both of the primitiue church, &amp; the beſt reformed in this age, with the fruits of them in furthering of the goſpel amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them, &amp; the want of the like with vs for default of the ſame. Vpon this ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Replier hath written a long diſcourſe, not only examining this matters conteyned in it, and ſpeaking to that purpoſe, but deſcanting in a maner vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery word, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for extrauagant matters, &amp; points impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand. Alſo for tautologies &amp; repetitions, &amp; much idle ſpeache, lengthned out with three or foure of <hi>Aeſopes</hi> fables, and ſuch like conceytes, as ſerued the pleaſant humour he is giuen vnto. Which length of handling matters had bin well beſtowed, before he came to the concluſion, in replying with ſound &amp; forcible reaſons, to the points debated. But ſeeing it is otherwiſe, I am to praye the readers pacience, while I make that anſwere, that is neceſſarie, which I will doe as ſhortly as I can, that I abuſe not the Reader, nor wearie my ſelfe with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one, that will not keepe his way. In the wordes of the concluſion, to the number of foure publique charges of the Church, he oppoſeth contrarie teſtimonies: the firſt whereof is, of a godly Sermon, vpon the twelft to the Romanes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, ſayeth he, nameth fiue. For anſwere he is to vnderſtande, that the fift, mentioned both there, &amp; by that Apoſtle, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder one of theſe foure, that is, vnder the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19103:36"/> For they that ſhewe mercie are ſuch of the Deacons, as regarde and looke to the ſicke and afflicted with like miſerie, needing their helpe. The next, is of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers, out of which he would gather, that Teachers are Doctors, as they are called there, into no neceſſarie function in the Church: becauſe it is ſayde there, concerning Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or Doctours in this manner: <q rend="inline">We are not ignorant, that there is a fourth kinde of Miniſters left vnto the Church of Church, which is alſo verie profitable where time and place doeth permitte: becauſe it is ſayde here, to be very profitable, where time and place doeth permit, hee gathereth, there is no neceſſitie of this office in the Church, which is no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. </q> For the ſame agreeth to all the outwarde pollicie of the Chriſte, and may be ſaide of it, and yet not take away the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, where it may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently be had. The Sacraments are left to the church by our Sauiour Chriſt, and are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable where time and place doe permit. So was Circumciſion the ordinance of God, and verie profitable in like maner, but ſometime time &amp; place permitted not to haue it, as in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. No more doe they permitte ſometime the Sacramentes to be miniſtred, which are ordayned by our Sauiour Chriſte, as in ſome grieuous perſecution, yet are they the perpetuall ordinances of the Lorde, though not ſimplie and abſolutelie neceſſarie to ſaluation: yet ſo neceſſarie, as the contempt and wilfull neglect of them is damnable. Therfore this ſpeech no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impugneth the miniſterie of the Teacher in the church. Nay contrariwiſe, it greatlie confirmeth both this &amp; the reſt. For, teaching this office, it acknowledgeth it very profitable, and left by our Sauiour Chriſt, vnto his Church, &amp; to be one of thoſe foure which are left, the other three being Paſtors El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders &amp; Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Wherby, as this charge, ſo al the reſt, are plainly confirmed to be very profitable, and to be left by Chriſt to his church for their edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſpiritual profit. Which booke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing th'only booke authoriſed for publike prayer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and taken as he ſaieth, from the Engliſhe Church at <hi>Geneua:</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:19103:37"/> ſo carying with it alſo th'allowance of the choſen companie of our countrie-men, then ſuffring for the Goſpell, and of the Church of <hi>Geneua:</hi> I doubt not, but ſo graue a teſtimonie, with any godly wiſe Man, will carie more credite and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with it, to perſwade men of th'ordinance of God in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, then not only all the ieſtes wherewith the Replyer ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth at them, but then his moſt colourable reaſons ſhalbe able to preuayle to the contrarie. Becauſe there are foure ſpeciall publike charges mentioned by the Declaration (which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged alſo by the Churches of <hi>Scotlande,</hi> of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and of ſuch of <hi>Englande,</hi> as were there for the Goſpell) as this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie declareth, and by the Churches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the lowe Countries, (as hath bin ſhewed, eſpeciallie in that kind of th'Elders office, which is moſt impugned) the Replyer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them a <hi>Tetrarchie,</hi> and maketh no ende of this vnſauorie ieſting ſpeache, forgetting th'exhortation (as it ſeemeth) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſayeth,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 4.6.</note> 
               <hi>Let your ſpirit be gracious, ſeaſoned with ſalte, giuing grace and edification to the hearers.</hi> But vnfitlie hath he ſought out this name for them out of the Arches. For the Scripture, whoſe ſpeach we are to followe, termeth them not by names carying ſhewe of worldly rule and lordly commaundement, which are giuen to Magiſtrates, but termeth them offices, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries, ſeruices, charges, functions, and ſuch like, and their worke, not to rule and commaunde, but to ſerue, to guyde, leade, ouerſee, direct, &amp; ſuch like. Theſe are alſo our ordinarie termes of them, wherein we reſt, &amp; leaue all names of Arches, for the Hierarchie, and degenerate Miniſterie, to whom they agree. Vpon this ſuppoſed difference of the <hi>Scotiſh Church,</hi> he taketh occaſion to enter into a diſcreete and likely compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Paſtours, Elders and Deacons, with the <hi>Triumuirate,</hi> ſo called of <hi>Antonius Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> who in the ende drewe all to him ſelfe. Whereby he would breede a ſuſpition, of ſome ſecrete miſchiefe, in mainteyninge the miniſteries of theſe foure publicke charges. Whereof I can not ſee, what other gounde he can haue, then that he hopeth, belike, by ſo

What hath come of this order in the Churches where it is receyued, but the right ſeruice of God, ſinceritie of faith, good examples, diligent preaching, due adminiſtring of the Sacramentes, moderate ſeueritie in cenſuring offences: finallie, the honour of God, of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, of his Goſpell, &amp; of the Church? He might more iuſtlie feare this, in the baſe miniſterie, that hath left the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, and embraced this preſent worlde. For, what is all that degenerate Hierarchie, but the image of the beaſt, ſpoken of in the Reuelation,<note place="margin">Apo. 13.24.</note> the beaſt noting the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, and the image of it, being the ſimilitude and likenes of the ſtate and gouernement of it, in the Church of Rome. Wherein the Pope reſembling <hi>Augustus Caeſar</hi> the Emperour, and ſuch as ſucceeded him: the Cardinals are the image of thoſe, by whoſe helpe he had oppreſſed the former ſtate of the Romanes, and continued his tyrannie ouer it, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſpoyle with them: Archbi hops, and Biſhops, other Magiſtrates of Prouinces and Countries. Which, as it began, in like maner, with oppreſſing the onely lawfull pollicie and adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church, ſo the end of it hath bin the moſt proude and ambitious tyrannie, that euer was in the worlde.</p>

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:19103:53"/> the concluſion riſeth not of this only, that theſe offices of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, Teachers, Elders and Deacons were ſometime appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God: but that they were appointed for the certaine ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ordinarie offices of the Church, to abide for euer. Shewe this (ſayeth he) and forthwith we yeelde. It hath bene alreadie ſhewed, and yet he yeeldeth not, for it hath bin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that, whereas theſe are of the giftes beſtowed by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our on the Church, all the reſt were extraordinarie, &amp; but for a time, as appeareth by their vſe and the giftes agreing to ſuch offices. But both the vſe and the gift, agreeing to theſe foure, is for all times, and giuen of GOD by ordinarie meanes, and therefore theſe, and theſe onely are perpetuall. The vſe of the Teacher, is to teache true religion and doctrine: of the Paſtor, to applie the doctrine by exhortation, reprehenſion, conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch other meanes as may ſerue moſt fitte for th'e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, and as the occaſions of the Church require. Elders are to looke to th'obedience and practiſe of the ſame in the life of the people: and they altogither, to guyde the publique aſſemblies in a reuerend order, and to carie the care of the ſtate of the Church, to call and diſmiſſe, to and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publique charge in it by due order, &amp; to cenſure offendours according as their offence is to be cenſured. Finallie, the Deacons are to relieue the poore and in miſerie. Theſe being (I ſay) the vſes of theſe charges, it is playne, they are no extraordinarie things, for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they are appointed, but neceſſarie and perpetuall: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the offices which God hath ordayned for ſuch vſes, muſt needes be eſteemed alike, perpetuall and neceſſarie.</p>
            <p>The ſame is to be ſaide of their giftes which are all ſuch, as God giueth vnto men, by ordinarie meanes. But, ſuch, are none of the other offices, neither for their vſe, nor for their giftes: and therefore theſe, and onely theſe, are neceſſarie and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for euer. Further alſo, the Apoſtles, ſetting by them ſelues, and by the Euangeliſtes, theſe functions amongeſt the Churches, doe plainly declare, they did it in this regarde, that whereas neither they nor the Euangeliſtes, for the dueties of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19103:53"/> their callings, could tarie ſtill with any one particular church, theſe ſhould be their guides, to continue and remaine with them for euer. Vpon theſe, and ſuch like reaſons declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the concluſion groweth and not barelie vpon this, that they were ſometimes ordayned of God.</p>
            <p>Thus paſſeth he forwarde (yet ſo as he looketh backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) to an amplification of the concluſion, wherein, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, gathereth togither, certaine principall reaſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming theſe offices, as of the Authour &amp; preſeruers of them, with the good fruite that followeth where they are eſtabliſhed, and the contrarie, where they are not. The firſte reaſon hee denieth, but ſtandeth not much vpon it. The ſeconde, of the Churches exerciſing this Diſcipline is of two partes, whereof the firſte is of the primitiue &amp; pure Church enlarged by note of the time it continued it it, which is, till the miſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, working a way for Antichriſtes pride and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, changed Gods ordinance, and ſo brought in all kinde of falſe doctrine and confuſion. To theſe wordes he taketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie exceptions, and firſt ſcorneth at it, that the primitiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che (which he him ſelfe calleth that time while the Apoſtles liued) is named the pure Church: and replyeth to it, that it was not very pure ſoone after the Apoſtles. Which is a replie of no value. For it ſuffiſeth for the matter in hande, that it was exerciſed by the Apoſtolicall Churches, which are called pure, not in regarde of obedience in life, but of that order, for the guyding of the Church, which by the Apoſtles was deliuered vnto them. We acknowledge that no aſſembly of men, yea that no particular man, is, or can be, or euer was (the Lorde him ſelfe onely excepted) free from all charge of ſinne in the ſight of God, according as it is ſaide, <hi>There is not one that doeth good, no not one.</hi> And agayne,<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.3.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19103:54"/> and onely by the redemption, that is in Christ Jeſus.</hi> This (I ſay) we acknowledge, notwithſtanding that thorough the ſame grace (according to the meaſure of the gift thereof, in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thankefulnes which we owe as the Lords redeemed) we endeuour to walke in a good conſcience without offence, and to approoue our vnfayened deſyre of obedience and well-doing in all things, both to God and Man. This I haue thought good to profeſſe, becauſe the Replyer, by a ſcornfull obſeruation of pure Church, would caſt vppon all ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a further reformation of our Church, an infamous ſpot of puritaniſme. A name which ſome popiſh or Samaritane prieſt well content that poperie and the Goſpell be ioyned togither, as they were ſometime,<note place="margin">2. King. 17.32.33.34.</note> to mingle Iudaiſme and Paganiſme, haue deuiſed, to reuile them with, that ſeeke any further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: and nowe, commonly taken vp, by Atheiſtes, to diſgrace and diſcountenance all that deſire to liue godlie. Which if it proceede, as of ſome time it hath done, it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but ere it be many yeares, pietie, and the feare of God, wil be as odious as any hereſie. This may ſuffice, to let the Replier vnderſtande, that the primitiue Church is not called pure in the Declaration, in regarde of their life and conuerſation, nor any ſignification giuen thereby, that there is, or can be in this worlde, in that ſence, any Church pure and free from ſinne. But as touching the order giuen to the Churches by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and receyued of them for the rule to guyde them ſelues by, in the adminiſtration and direction of eccleſiaſticall affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, the primitiue Church was pure, in the Apoſtles time, and ſo had it bin at ſundrie times before the Apoſtles, and may be alſo in this time, for any impoſſibilitie that is in this matter. The heauenlie paterne ſhewed to Moſes in the mountayne, can not be denied to haue bin pure.<note place="margin">Exod. 25.40 Heb. 8.5. Heb. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>But Moſes was faithfull in all the houſe of God, and did all things according to the paterne whiche was ſhewed him. For hee was faithefull, not onely in the things that concerned the holiest place of the houſe of God, or the Sanctuarie next vnto it, but alſo in the outwarde Sanctuarie or court, yea in the things of the lowest Court of the Lordes houſe.</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:19103:54"/> Neither thought he it inough, (as many doe nowe) to regarde onely the principall things, as the Arke of Couenaunt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the two tables of the Lawe, and other precious &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly memorialles of the noble actes of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 36.</note> nor both them and the next vnto them, as th'Altar, the Table,<note place="margin">cap. 37.</note> and the golden Candleſticke, but alſo all the veſſels, implementes,<note place="margin">cap. 38.</note> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of the Tabernacle, euen to the baſons and beeſomes, to euerie pinne of the ioyned worke,<note place="margin">cap. 39.42.</note> to euery ringe of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, to the skinnes that couered it, and to euery inche of length, breadth, and depth, as the Lorde had appointed. And not in the place onely that was appointed for the ſeruice of God, but for the whole order and maner of the ſeruice, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the kindes of Miniſteries, and what duetie was to bee done by euery one. This was a perfect and pure order of a Church, receyued of God by Moſes, and by him ſettled and continued in his time amongſt that people.

               <hi>let him acknowledge that the thinges I write vnto you, are the commaundements of the Lorde:</hi> and ſayeth of him ſelfe, that which agreeth to th'other Apoſtles, that is, <hi>That the Lorde of mercie had giuen to him to be faithfull, and ſo accounted him, and they were all true witneſſes of Ieſus Christ.</hi> Whereby it can not be doubted, but th'order which they taught the Churches to keepe, for maintenance of the faith, exerciſes, and obedience of the Goſpell amongſt them, being as perfect and pure, as that which the ſame Lord
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19103:55"/> had ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mountaine, and the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as faithfull as <hi>Moſes,</hi> it can not bee doubted, I ſaye, but that the Churches in regard of that adminiſtration and polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, were pure and perfect. And not onely in their time (as in the former had bin in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi>) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the time of ſuch as with them had gouerned the church and ſeene the mightie hande of God working with them in the aduancement of the Goſpell, as the like had bin before in the Elders that ouerliued the noble worthie <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> Whiche being ſo, I can ſee no cauſe, the ſame order being left vs from point to point, in their holy writinges: but that the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Dauid</hi> being fallen downe, the ruines of it, may be ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, and all the ſtrength and beautie of the houſe of God in that behalfe reſtored againe: if there be that religion, vertue, and zeale, which ought to be in thoſe, at whoſe handes the Lord doeth require it. And thus much to ſhew what is meant by the primitiue and pure church, and withall that there may be a pure church, in regarde of the order for directing &amp; guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all eccleſiaſticall matters, notwithſtanding the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the nature of man be ſuch, as were the order moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet wil adminiſter and execute it with many humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.

            <p>From this reaſon, that theſe miniſteries haue bin retayned in the primitiue church, he proceedeth to the note of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it in the ſame, which is ſaide by the Declaration to haue bin, till the miniſterie of iniquitie, working a way for An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſts pride &amp; preſumption, chaunged Gods ordinance, and brought in all kinde of falſe doctrine &amp; confuſion. Nay, who there, maiſters mine, not ſo ſayth the Replier (ſuch is his vain, that I ſay no more) according to which, dallying a whyle about the ſence, he reſolueth that if it had bin ſuch, till the miſterie of iniquitie began to worke a way, &amp;c. the Declaration had kept better within boundes. This doubt of the ſence might
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19103:55"/> haue bin ſpared, it being not hard for him, at the firſte, to haue conceyued it ſo, as he did at the laſt, this being the playn ſenſe, that till ſuch time, as Sathan began to make a way to the king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of Antichriſt, &amp; to all kinde of falſe doctrine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, this order continued. For the pride of that kingdome of Antichriſt being ſo great, as it is this day, and hath bin now for many ages, and the falſe doctrines &amp; confuſions being ſo many, as they haue bin now a long time, this kingdome could not be ſet vp in one day, nor al the abhominable ſuperſtitions and idolatries of it brought in vpon a ſuddain, all the holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of god in the whole order of the church being againſt it. Therefore, theſe, one after another, and by litle and little, (that the fraude might not appeare) were chaunged and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that by ſuch proceeding, it might bee eaſilie ouercome in the end: which at the beginning, if it had bin openly &amp; at once attempted, could not haue bin conquered by any violence. As in the ſiege of a ſtrong citie, the enimie entreth not at firſt and at once into the gates, but by mines &amp; batteries ouerthroweth ſome principall bulwarkes, &amp; places of defence to the citie, &amp; offence to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſo he may after the more quietly ſcale the walles, or force the gates therof. So the citie of God, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the rules of diſcipline, as with walles, towres, &amp; bulle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks: the enimie firſt ſought how by his pioners &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to caſt down ſome of the principall ſtrengthes, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before he could enter it &amp; ſeate him ſelf in the middſt of the temple of God. And as where a citie is well policied &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, hauing good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wholſome lawes &amp; ſtatutes for the ruling of it, and worthy Magiſtrates, that gouerne wiſely and iuſtly according to the ſame. If any man would oppreſſe ſuch a ſtate, and make him ſelfe maiſter of it, in vaine ſhould he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to doe it, whyle thoſe lawes and Magiſtrates doe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: And therefore would corrupte firſte ſome of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, by degrees, and then afterwarde, worke ſuch altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the lawes, as might be leſt ſenſible, that by ſuch meanes he might in the ende, by his ſubtle and cunninge practiſes,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19103:56"/> attayne to that tyrannous rule, which if he ſhould make ſhew of in the beginning, he could not doe by any force: euen ſo hath Sathan by his ſecrete and ſutle meanes and practiſes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to tyranniſe the citie of God, firſt corrupted ſuch as were of ſpeciall truſt in it, and had greateſt charges committed to them, and after by their meanes altered by litle and litle, the orders and lawes of the Citie, in ſuch ſorte, as at the laſt he ſet vp the kingdome of Antichriſt, and brought in all kinde of falſe doctrine and confuſion.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> purpoſed to oppreſſe the ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> he vſed many preparations and meanes vnto it, whiche were not eaſie to be diſcerned, yea ſuch as might ſeeme to be great ſtayes to the preſeruation of it. His greatnes riſing by alliances and employmentes abroade the encreaſing of his forces, the diſpenſing with home lawes in his reſpect, the continuance of his Dictatorſhip, and ſuch like, were in apparance the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to vpholde and mainteyne the ſtate of Rome, and ſome of them might haue bin ſo in deede, if they had bin beſtowed vpon a ſubiect faithfull and loyall. But in an ambitious mind they ſo increaſed his greatnes and his ſtrength, as the ſtate it ſelfe became to weake for him. Such a tree as <hi>Daniel</hi> had ſhewed vnto him in a viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repreſent the kingdome of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4.8.9.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Eze. 31.6.</note> and as <hi>Ezekiell</hi> mentioneth to like purpoſe in his prophecie, whoſe bowes and brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches are like great trees, and the armes of it, as the Cedars of Libanus, ſo as all the fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the heauens make their neſtes in them, &amp; all the beaſtes of the fielde lye in the ſhadowe of the ſame: ſuch a tree (I ſay) groweth not vp in a night, like the gourde of <hi>Ionas,</hi> but in many yeeres:<note place="margin">Iona. 4.10.</note> receiuing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day to day ſome increaſes, though not ſenſible to the eye in any one inſtant, or in a day, or in a weeke, yet in time it appeareth that it did encreaſe, and at laſt groweth to huge bignes. Nowe to demaunde, what daye or what yeare it grewe in, were a queſtion that ſhould haue ſmall reaſon in it: ſuch a tree being many yeares a growing, ſo as it can not be ſaide, that it grewe in ſuch a yeare, but onely, that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19103:56"/> it, was growing ſo many yeares, till at the laſt it came to exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue greatnes. Euen thus hath it come to paſſe in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichriſt, the <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> that hath burnt the Citie of God, and the king of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the citie of all confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Weſt. To demande therefore, as the Replyer doeth, &amp; as Papiſts do, ſome certaintie of the time, when this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome grewe, and of euery thing it conſumed, as he ſaith here, of th'office of Elders, whereby it grewe, and increaſed: is an impertinent queſtion, and can not proue, that therefore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than did not, by chaunge of Gods ordinance in this behalfe, increaſe and ſtrengthen him ſelfe. It ſuffiſeth vs to ſhewe, that in ſo many yeares, this tree was a growing: in whoſe bowes at the laſt, euery foule and hatefull birde nowe doeth neſtle, and that a meanes of the immeaſurable greatnes of it hath bin, the chaunging of th'ordinances of God. Whiche appeareth manifeſtlie in this, that theſe offices (for the Declaration ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the ordinance of God chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in them all) are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared to haue bin vſed in the Churches in the time of the Apoſtles, as ordinarie offices, and that the ſame being now of manie yeares not in vſe, eyther in part, or altogither, afore this laſt reſtoring of the Goſpell agayne in this age, they are all founde to be tranſferred to others, who by them ſelues or their officers, diſpoſed of all that the other were wont to doe. Which chaunge for the name of Biſhop, was common to all the Miniſters of the worde, as it is euident in the 20. of the Actes, and other places.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.1. 1. Tim. 3.1.</note> The arrogating of this name by any one of that calling, as a peculiar title to him ſelfe, was ſome chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that which folowed. The ſame name in the Scriptures is neuer giuen vnto any in reſpect of the Miniſters of the worde, as to note one ſet ouer them, to ſee them doe their dueties, (as the high Prieſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the lawe of Moſes,) but alwayes in regarde of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the flocke, the charge, ouerfight, and guydance, of whom onely was committed to them. When this ordinance of God was ſo farre chaunged, that by this worde was noted
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19103:57"/> one, ſet ouer both the flockes and the ſhepheardes, endewed with a power and authoritie to direct &amp; correct both, as might ſeeme good vnto him: ſo much more as was diminiſhed of the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god, was added to the aduancement of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie which Sathan, cunningly, by ſuch degrees, ſought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance. But when theſe Biſhops contented not them ſelues to take the name to them as peculiar, and an authoritie not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of the Church they ſtoode charged with, and the Miniſters of the worde with them in the ſame, but taking all occaſions which might further their ambition, as of hauing moderated the Synodes of certaine circuites, of the fewnes of ſufficient Preachers, of the voluntarie reſpect whiche was borne them for their pietie and giftes, of reſort from ſundrie partes neare vnto them, for their counſell, of the preheminence, wealth, and ſtate of the Cities wherein they were ſeated, and ſuch like challenged to them ſelues, the like authoritie ouer the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Miniſters of a large circuite: this ſteppe was not farre from the ſeate, whereon the man of ſinne was to ſitte him downe. Another degree aboue this was it, when as Biſhoppes had dealt with their fellowes the Paſtours of the Churches: ſo likewiſe other dealt with them, and became Archbiſhops, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging and exerciſing authoritie ouer all the Churches, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Biſhops of a whole Prouince. But when as Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Prouinces were in like ſort ſubiected to other, as they had made the Biſhops ſubiect to them, and that foure Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes diuided all Chriſtian churches in the worlde, amongeſt them ſelues, ranging Archbiſhops vnder them, &amp; doing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as they had done to the Biſhops, and the Biſhopps to the Paſtours: it remained only, that one of thoſe foure ſhould toppe the reſt, to make him ſelfe lorde of all, and vniuerſall Biſhop ouer the Church. Which diſorder increaſed after this Hierarchie for multitude of cauſes brought to them out of ſo large circuites, began firſt to ſlacke their preachinge, and to growe negligent, and in the ende to giue it ouer, and preache ſeldome (as vpon hye and ſolemne dayes) or not at all.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:19103:57"/>
            <p>After alſo, that Emperours &amp; Kings began to be Chriſtians, and they to growe in fauor with them, and to receyue ſo great giftes and honours of them, as to beare the port and ſtate of worldlie Princes, and to meddle with ciuill cauſes, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the ſtate, growing thereby not only to neglect, but euen to deſpiſe the hye and moſt holy ſeruice of God, the preaching of the Goſpell: after all this (I ſay) what remayned, but that the moſt ambitious of the foure Patriarkes ſhould by practiſe with ſome mightie Potentate, ſet his foote vpon the heads of th'other Patriarkes, and rayſe him ſelfe into the ſeate &amp; chaire of Antichriſt. Which, notwithſtanding two of them, who were ſeated in the two chiefe Cities of the Eaſt and Weſt Empire, <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſtriue togither for a whyle: yet in the ende the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> preuayled, being Biſhoppe of that citie, which had bin Lady of all the Earth for a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger time, and hauing fitter occaſions ſeruing to it, as firſt of th'abſence, the Emperours, after by meanes of the decay of the Empire in the Eaſt, and of his more ambitious diligence, who had diuers ways attempted it before, &amp; eſpecially becauſe it was prepared for him that was placed in the Citie that ſtandeth vpon ſeauen hilles. Which was brought to paſſe by practiſe with <hi>Zimri</hi> the murtherer of his Lorde and Maiſter, that is with <hi>Phocas</hi> the murderer of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, by whoſe fauour the name and title of vniuerſall Biſhop was obteyned. After whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che time, the Biſhops of that ſeate, by wicked practiſes, and cunning meanes, ſetting th'Imperiall Crowne vppon whoſe head it ſeemed good to them, increaſed them ſelues excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie, by the donation of <hi>Pepin,</hi> and others, in ritches, lands, temporalties, and in worldlie Dominions and ſtate. Whereby enlarging their power in church matters, and nouriſhing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites for the purpoſe, at the laſt, not onely by temporal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but by yoke of conſcience, vnder pretence of <hi>Peeters</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, giuen to him by our Sauiour, and of ſucceſſion to <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> this man of ſinne, ſeated him ſelfe in the middeſt of the temple of God, that is, of that people whiche ſometimes had
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19103:58"/> bin the temple of God, and exalted him ſelfe aboue all that is worſhipped or called God. Loe, the ſeate of all abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">2. Teſ. 2.4.</note> and the ſtayres, degrees, and ſteppes, from the loweſt to the higheſt, whereby Sathan made way in chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, (as it is ſaide in the Declaration) to Antichriſts pride, and after he had ſo done, brought in all manner of falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and confuſion. This way to Antichriſtes pride in chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ordinances of GOD, the Replier is careful, ſhoulde not bee vnderſtood in anie ſorte of Biſhops and Archbiſhops, as if any ordinance of God had bin chaunged in creating ſuch offices as are exerciſed by them, or that Antichriſt could haue any thing the readier way to his ſeate by them: and would caſt this vpon the publike charges inſtituted of God to bee in his Church. His firſte reaſon to proue this is, that Biſhops and Archbiſhops were in the primitiue Church. Whereof, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this be not the fitte place to ſpeake, and that I haue alreadie refuſed for this cauſe to make him any anſwere till he come orderly where it is to bee debated, yet, becauſe I ſee he dreameth ſtill of Biſhops and Archbiſhops, and that both vnſeaſonablie and importunatlie he calleth vppon it, it ſhall not peraduenture be amiſſe, to giue ſome anſwere in the meane time, till he bring forth the reſt that he hath to ſpeake in their behalfe.</p>
            <p>It is to be remembred here, firſt, howe litle reckoninge hee hath made of the proofes alleadged for th'office of Elders, the which yet are ſuch, as that the holy Scriptures make mention of ſuch an office to haue bin in the Church in thoſe times, &amp; declare to what vſe it ſerued, and that there were ſuch appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all the churches of the Apoſtles: who, to them and to the Miniſters of the worde committed the ſtanding and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie care ouer the churches. Which proofes being ſo ſmallie accounted of by the Replier, as they are, we are vndoubtedlie to haue from him, ſufficient and ſtrong argumentes, authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall recordes and authorities, playne and cleare euidences, for anie matter he will vndertake to prooue. But eſpeciallie,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19103:58"/> as his iſſue is greater, ſo his euidences are to be clearer, &amp; the higher th'offices are in dignitie and power aboue the office of Elders, of ſo much more certaine and chiefe authoritie are his rolles to be, and his pleas mightie and forcible, ſeeinge there are great royalties and regalites belonging to thoſe offices, whoſe patentes he would iuſtifie. The firſt entrance into his proofe, is ſuch in deede. For he pleadeth the donation of god, the writing and inſtrument of our Sauiour Chriſte, ſigned with the great ſeale of Heauen and Earth, the power whereof the Lorde declareth to be giuen vnto him. Which if it be ſo, ſurely then could theſe offices neither receyue any chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, nor conſequentlie, the chaunge of them, bee any way to Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes pride. But let vs heare what his reaſons are: A man would thinke, breaking ſo often and ſo violentlie into this cauſe, that from Moſes, throughout all the Prophetes, he would ſhew vs this matter, and after by the whole colledge of th'Apoſtles, as by a cloudde of witneſſes without all exception, he woulde haue oppreſſed for euer, all that dare ſay (as he ſpeaketh) that theſe offices of Biſhops and Archbiſhops,<note place="margin">Pag. 78.</note> wrought any waye to Antichriſtes pride. But for all witneſſes he bringeth in the Apoſtle Paule: A witneſſe in deed without all exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though he be alone (notwithſtanding euery matter was wont to bee confirmed by two or three witneſſes) for the higheſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, whoſe ſecretarie he was, in that he wrote,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.5. Mat. 18.16.</note> ſo as all creatures both men and Angells are to reſt in that, which hee by the will of God hath deliuered: let vs heare therefore what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in this cauſe.</p>
            <p>In the primitiue Churche (ſayeth the Replier) <hi>Titus</hi> was made an Archbiſhoppe, and had many other Biſhops vnder his gouernement. If it be demaunded by whom hee was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, this was (ſayeth hee) Saint Paules acte, whoſe acte no doubt was approued of God him ſelfe. No doubt in deede, but what that Apoſtle and the reſt did, concerninge a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led order to gouerne the Church by in all time to come, but it was the acte of God him ſelfe. But if Archbiſhops bee inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19103:59"/> of God in the Church, I demaunde, whether this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution be alterable or no, and whether Princes, or the Church, aduiſing of ſome other order which they ſhall thinke better, may put downe the Archbiſhop, and ſet vp an officer of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde for that purpoſe. If they may, then is the wiſedome of God ſubiect to the will of man, and they made wiſer then hee, who is onely wiſe, who taketh wiſe men in their wyles, confoundeth them by thoſe whom they eſteeme as ſimple,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.17</note> &amp; when they would bee wiſeſt, doeth make them ſtarke fooles. If it may not,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.19.20.27. Rom. 1.22.</note> as I ſuppoſe the Replier will do god that honor, not to make his ordinances ſubiect to the will of man, nor to adore fleſhe and bloude, aboue God bleſſed for euer, Amen: then doeth he playnely confeſſe, (whiche in all his treatiſe he impugneth) that there is an externall order, and forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement ordayned of God for the guydance of the church: If hee be perſwaded of in conſcience, as hee would ſeeme to bee, by going about to prooue their authoritie as by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let him as francklie confeſſe it, as they doe, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the ſupremacie of the Pope to be due to him, <hi>iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and which neceſſarilie followeth hereof, lette him denie, that Princes or any creature, may lawfullie cauſe this office to ceaſe to be exerciſed in the Church: And then our queſtion being ended of the generall, whether there bee any certayne externall order for all eccleſiaſticall matters eſtabliſhed of God, as confeſſed and agreed on both partes: let vs then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, whiche onely remayneth, Whether that whiche hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth to bee the order of GOD conſiſtinge in Biſhops and Archebiſhops, bee that in deede, whiche God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or the order ſett downe in the Declaration of Miniſters of the worde, Elders, and Deacons.</p>
            <p>There are Biſhoppes, who, notwithſtanding peraduenture they can bee as well content to ſuffer him to perſwade that their authoritie is from GOD, as the Biſhop of Rome is, that ſome doe the like for him, yet in them ſelues, will ſcorne this ſimplicitie, as knowing vndoubtedly (whiche they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19103:59"/> confeſſed) that they holde onely of the donation of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by ciuill ſtatutes, that power and authoritie whiche they exerciſe. But to returne to his reproofe. Howe maye it appeare, that Paule, whoſe acte no doubt (as he ſayeth) was approoued by GOD him ſelfe, did create <hi>Titus</hi> an Archebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. It is a maruell that hee beginneth with an Archbi hop, whereas good order would haue required hee ſhould firſt haue prooued the inſtituting of a Biſhop ouer other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, ere hee had come to ſhewe an Archebiſhop ouer Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes. But, to take it as it hath pleaſed him to deliuer it, whereby maye it appeare, that <hi>Titus</hi> was made an Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and exerciſed (as hee ſayeth) Arch-epiſcopall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? For proofe hee referreth him ſelfe to another place, ſayinge, wee haue ſeene this partlie alreadie. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to returne to the place where hee ſpake of this before, and to looke what is to be ſeene there.</p>
            <p>In that place, which is (as I take it) in the pages 64. and 65. hee ſayeth what eccleſiaſticall office <hi>Titus</hi> had, the verie ſubſcription of Saint Paules epiſtle vnto him doeth declare, being this to <hi>Titus</hi> the firſte elected Biſhop of the Church of the <hi>Cretenſes.</hi> This is the Recorde he bringeth out to prooue the office of an Archbiſhop. Wherein yet, it is apparant, that here is no mention at all, neyther of the office, nor of the name of an Archbiſhop. It is ſayde in deede, that <hi>Titus</hi> was firſt elected Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Candie,</hi> but of his Archiepiſcopall iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or name, here is no worde. If our profes for the offices we affirme to be neceſſarie and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the Church, were not more pregnaunt then this, and if when we vndertake to prooue a Paſtour, we ſhould bring out euidences for a Teacher, the nexte officer in the Churche vnto him, or if when we would prooue a Teacher, we ſhould ſhewe proofe for an Elder, who is next him, or pretendinge to prooue the function of Elders, ſhould alleadge teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that doe concerne Deacons, as the Replyer heere go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge aboute to ſhewe and prooue an Archebiſhoppe,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19103:60"/> bringeth a place that ſpeaketh onely of a Biſhop, who in his Hierarchie is next in place and dignitie to the Archbiſhop: ſuch proofes were worthie all the ſcornes, wherewith he hath vnworthily, and without cauſe, ſcorned the ſounde and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teſtimonies produced for euery publique charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Church. But yet if he come ſo neare it as the office of a Biſhop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch as he pretendeth to mainteyne, though hee finde not th'Archbiſhoprike he ſeeketh, yet if he get a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, at Paules handes, his labour in ſeeking is largely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced. What force therefore this euidence may be of, for a Biſhop, let vs examine. In the ende of the Epiſtle vnto Titus, where copies of greateſt credite haue onely this clauſe, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Titus is finiſhed, ſome other haue this additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he produceth, which yet, neyther the Syrian, nor the olde Latine interpreter, doe reade. Wherevppon Maſter <hi>Beza,</hi> the beſt interpretour of the newe Teſtament, ſayeth, That this is a playne forgerie. For further proofe he addeth three reaſons, one from the mention of a Biſhop in this ſubſcription, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as (ſayeth he) that tyrannie of the Epiſcopall degree had not yet forceably entred into the Church. So as the difference of the time ſheweth, this could not bee Paules writing, nor bee truely ſayde of Titus, in whoſe life time, and longe after, no ſuch office was knowen in the Church. Another, is from the diuers office of Titus, which was of an Euangeliſt, the nature whereof is wholy repugnant to a Biſhop: that being not to ſtaye in any place, but to followe the Apoſtles, and by their direction to order the Churches: and the Biſhops beinge to ſitte ſtill, and to ouerſee onely his owne circuit. The thirde, is a playne contradiction to the vndoubted writing of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, ſubſcribed in deede with his owne hande, for ſo he ſigned all his letters to preuent all fraudulent and deceytfull practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of attributing to him that which was not his, whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction appeareth thus: Towarde the ende of this Epiſtle to Titus, the Apoſtle ſayeth, Endeuour to come to me to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copolis,</hi> for there I haue determined to winter. In whice verſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19103:60"/> it is to be noted, that the Apoſtle ſayeth not, for <hi>here</hi> I haue purpoſed to winter, which he ſhould haue done if hee had bin at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> when he wrote this: But, I haue purpoſed to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>there,</hi> as being in another place at the writing of his letter, and declaring his purpoſe to goe from the ſame vnto <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> where he meant to tarie the winter.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.21 Coloſ. 4.18 2. Theſ. 3.17.</note> This being playne to be thus vnderſtoode in the wordes of th'Apoſtle: this fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſubſcription ſayth,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.12.</note> Written from <hi>Nicopolis</hi> of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> as if the Apoſtle at the writing of this letter had bene at <hi>Nichopolis,</hi> directlie contrarie to the wordes and ſenſe of the Apoſtle. Whereby it is playne, that this ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was none of Paules, but added to his letter, by ſome of later yeares, and of meane vnderſtanding, that could not diſcerne ſo palpable a repugnancie betwene the epiſtle it ſelfe, and ſuch a ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This then being all the profe that the replyer for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (notwithſtanding his importunate and vnſeaſonable bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon this cauſe) is able to make, to prooue the office of an Archbiſhop: the Reader may perceyue what authoritie it ought to haue in the conſcience of any Chriſtian man, the beſt euidence &amp; witnes that can be produced for the maintenance of it, being a razed rolle, and a ſuborned witnes, and as they ſpeake in Weſtminſter hall, <hi>A knight of the Post,</hi> euen ſuche another as the Biſhop of Roomes proctours would haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his vſurpation and vniuſt authoritie by, if the Fathers of that time in <hi>Africke</hi> had not diſcouered his fraude and follie. Thus we ſee, what cauſe he hath to breake ſo often into this matter, for any thing he can prooue by this euidence. But if this fayle him to proue Biſhops and Archbiſhops to haue bin in the primitiue Church, he hath another ſure argument that can not diſappoint him.</p>
            <p>There were Paſtours and Teachers in the primitiue church, the Declaration ſayeth, Elders alſo and Deacons, but ſayeth the Replier, the office of a Biſhop or Archbiſhop is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the office of a Paſtour or Teacher, ſo as Biſhoppes or Archbiſhops in the ſubſtance of their office are Paſtours or
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19103:61"/> Teachers in the Church, and as hee addeth in the next page before, ſuch as haue bin Deacons too. For anſwere herevnto, I denie, that they are either Paſtors or Teachers: for the reaſons folowing. Such offices as may not be executed by vertue of the forme of ordination of Paſtors and Teachers, but require an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other forme of ordination diuerſe from it, doe themſelues dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſubſtance from the offices of Paſtours and Teachers. For thus the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.16.17.21.</note> proueth the prieſthoode of our Sauiour Chriſt, to be diuers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Leuiticall prieſthood, becauſe the forme of ordination differed, the one being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an othe, and for a time, the other with an othe, and for euer.</p>
            <p>But the offices of Biſhops and Archbiſhops, are ſuch, as by vertue of that calling of Paſtours and Teachers, can not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, but require a further particular forme of ordination, diuers from the other, as appeareth by the booke of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. Therefore the offices of Biſhops and Archbiſhops, are in ſubſtance diuerſe from the offices of Paſtours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agayne,</hi> All Paſtours and Teachers are by bonde of their office and calling to preache the worde with all faithfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 2. Tim 2.3. Act. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But Biſhops and Archbiſhops ſtande not bounde by bond of their calling to preache it, for which cauſe either they leaue it altogither, or preache ſeldome, and vpon high and ſolemne dayes, and then onely at their pleaſure, when they preach, and not by any bond of their calling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> Biſhops and Archbiſhops are not in their offices Paſtours and Teachers.</p>
            <p>Further, all offices that are the ſame in ſubſtance, are of like and equall power. Therefore if the offices of Biſhops &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops be the ſame in ſubſtance with Paſtours and Teachers, then is their power one and equall with theirs: at the leaſt in Miniſterie of ſpirituall grace, as alſo in worde they pretende them to be. That they are not equall, appeareth in that, no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19103:61"/> nor Teacher may doe ſundrie thinges, which are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them ſelues to be, and ſome of them in deede are in their due adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, miniſteries of ſpirituall grace. For Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is ſaide to be a meanes of increaſe of ſpirituall grace and ſtrength. Abſolution is a miniſterie of ſpirituall grace, as teſtifying, and aſſuring the abſolued, in the worde of the great King of Kings, that his ſinnes are forgiuen him. Ordination to the Miniſterie, is alſo a miniſterie of ſpirituall grace, not onely in regarde of the office, but alſo of the encreaſe of grace beſtowed vpon ſuch as are duelie ordayned to it, the Lorde him ſelfe authour of the calling, giuing according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to ſuch as in faith thereof, and in obedience to his good pleaſure, yeelde vnto it ſuch increaſe of grace as the newe charge by the will of God layde vpon him, and vndertaken in hope of Gods aſſiſtance doeth require. In all which miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Paſtours and Teachers whom yet GOD putteth in truſt with the worde and meſſage of reconciliation and life, and with his holy Sacramentes, the ſeales of God to giue further aſſurance of the ſame, may not deale by vertue of ſuch their calling, but onely Biſhops and Archbiſhops. Therefore their power and miniſterie being ſo diuers, th'offices them ſelues muſt needes alſo differ.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, all Paſtours and Teachers are to be ordained to the attendance vpon a certen particular Church and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or Pariſhe, as we vſe moſt to call it. For ſo the Apoſtles <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did, and the reſt:<note place="margin">Tit 1.</note> So <hi>Paule</hi> gaue charge to <hi>Titus</hi> to ordeine them, and ſo were all they ordained of whom we reade in the holy Scriptures. Which alſo the verie ende, vſe, nature, and relation they haue to the Church where they are to ſerue, doeth declare. Therefore it is ſaide to all the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes 20.28</note> that they ſhould looke to that Churche whereof the holy Ghoſt had made them Biſhops or Ouerſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: ſo to all the Elders of the Churches of the Iewes diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.2.</note> that they ſhould feede the flocke of God whiche depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon them. Which point alſo ſome of the auncient Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19103:62"/> eſteemed ſo materiall, as they decreed, the ordination which was not to the certaine charge of ſome particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhould be voyde, and of none effect. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neceſſarie in all Paſtours and Teachers, is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie in Biſhops and Archbiſhops. For their ordination is not to anie particular Church, but to a whole Dioces or Prouince. And if before ſuch ordination they had charge of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, or were beneficed as the moſt common ſpeach is, ſuch benefices are then voyde, and they diſcharged by law, ſo as they are to be giuen to another. So incompatible the true duetie and office of a faithfull Miniſter of the worde, is in lawe eſteemed to bee, with the office of a Biſhop or Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. I might adde alſo, that Paſtours and Teachers, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther functions Eccleſiaſticall, deale onely with eccleſiaſticall matters, ſuch as agree to their ſeuerall kindes and places. For our Sauiour teſtifieth his kingdome not to be of this worlde.<note place="margin">Iohn 18.36.</note> And from the beginning to the time of our Sauiour, (ſince the Prieſthoode beſtowed vpon <hi>Aaron</hi>) the two powers haue bin in the ordinarie gouernement of Gods people, by the Lords owne ordinance ſundred, not onely in perſons, houſes, and kinreds, but in their tribes: ſo as none of the tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> might exerciſe the Prieſthoode, but onely they, that were of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> and the tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> was to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the ſeruice of the Tabernacle, and were neyther to enioye the kingdome, nor to beare ciuill offices, but the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, and the cauſes of the King, had their ſeuerall triall, officers and Iudges. But this, a Biſhop or Archbiſhop, euen by his ordination, is not onely not bounde vnto, but of the contrarie, being ordayned to exerciſe the office of a Biſhoppe, according to the worde of God, and the ordinances of this Realme, is to meddle with ciuill iuſtice. For the worde of God, not ſpeaking any one worde of ſuch an office, and the ordinances of the Realme, laying vpon them offices &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in ciuill affaires, they intermedle with all cauſes by reaſon of their office. I might note many other repugnances in-their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19103:62"/> offices, with the lawfull charges of Paſtours and Teachers, as their immoderate power in dealing with all eccleſiaſticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of gouernement alone, in ordayning Miniſters, giuing and calling in licences, cenſuring, ſuſpending, exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating, abſoluing, &amp; ſuch like. But theſe reaſons may ſuffice to ſhew that otherwiſe then the Replyer mainteyneth Biſhoppes and Archbiſhops, ſuch as he ſpeaketh of, are not, nor can not, in any iuſt and true account be reckoned Paſtours &amp; Teachers. Such in deede they may haue bin, and were firſte ordayned to be, and therefore ought to haue continued in that calling. But accepting of th'offices of Biſhops and Archbiſhops, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are ſo many things, as haue bin ſhewed, repugnant to the functions of Paſtours and Teachers, they can not in any ſorte, be eſteemed trew Paſtours and Teachers of the church, ſuch as our Sauiour appointed for the worke of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but are a thing degenerate, and growen out of kinde, a humane creature, and an inſtitution and ordinance of Kings and Princes. Thus much may ſuffice, to ſhewe that Biſhops and Archbi hops are not Paſtours and Teachers. Whereby it is playne, to be no conſequence whiche the Replier maketh for them in this place, that is, becauſe there were Paſtors and Teachers in the primitiue Church, that therefore there were Biſhops and Archbiſhops alſo in that time. Hee addeth they are ſuch as haue bene Deacons too, which being admitted, it followeth not, becauſe they haue bin Deacons, and nowe are Biſhops or Archbiſhops, that therefore Biſhops and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were in the primitiue Church. But I denie that euer they were right and lawfull Deacons. For a Deacon is an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall officer attending the poore of the Church, whoſe Deacon he is. The trueth of this is moſt euident by the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of whoſe inſtitution we reade in the ſixt of the Actes, where the Apoſtles diſcharging them ſelues of this care and ſeruice, determined and bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded their office of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip for euer after within the boundes of preachinge and prayers, and the Deacons office in that which they diſcharge
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19103:63"/> them ſelues of, that is, in the attendance of the poore. Which appeareth alſo by the 12. to the Romanes, where their office is limited in like maner.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Deaconſhippe hee ſpeaketh of, which they haue had, is no ſuch matter, but a meere humane inſtitution, a degree to prieſthoode, a power to baptiſe, and reade the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Litargie, without power to miniſter the Lordes Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or to preach by vertue of that calling, and is nothing like the ordinance of GOD for the reliefe of the poore. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, euen that alſo is not trew, whiche the Replier ſaieth that they haue bin Deacons too. In deede, they haue come by the Deacons bagge, and got into their hands that which by th'or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God and the auncient commons of the Church, ſhould be diſtributed by the Deacons, to the comfort of the poore. Which the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is in all duetie to God to require at their handes, &amp; to reſtore to the former right vſe againe, as he is, other partes of their liuings, and namelie that which ought to be the liuing of the Paſtors &amp; Teachers, which attende vpon the ſeruice of the people, in teaching and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cting them in true religion: whoſe liutngs being taken away and caſt into thoſe ſeas would be reſtored againe: that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple giuing their goods to be taught in the knowledge of God, &amp; not able to giue any more, do not periſhe, for wante of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but may receyue the fruite of this their liberalitie. But this, becauſe I haue not further occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this place, I forbeare to debate at large, onely by occaſion of their Deaconſhippe, I haue in a word noted their iuſt dealing as with the poore and the Deacons, ſo alſo with the Paſtors and Teachers, &amp; with all the people of God. Whereby appeareth that howſoeuer they are tranſformed &amp; now are neither Paſtours, Teachers, Elders nor Deacons, yet (ſauing the worke and labour of theſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in preaching vnto the people, and watching ouer them, with the Lordes watche, and ſeruing the neceſſities of the poore) they haue wholy deuoured them all. All the power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and liuing, both of Paſtours, Teachers and Deacons,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19103:63"/> yea and the treaſure of the poore alſo, being poſſeſſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed by them. Thus haue I anſwered his two reaſons allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to proue Biſhops and Archbiſhops to haue bin in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church.</p>
            <p>In this place, affirming them to be in their office and kinde of miniſterie, Paſtours and Teachers, yet, ſaith he, ſith he is the ordainer, or ordinarie of them, and ouerſeer both of them &amp; the people, he is in dignitie of another office, and kinde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie different from them. For anſwere wherevnto he is to vnderſtande, that the worde of God giueth not this authoritie to a Biſhop, to be ouerſeer of the people, and alſo of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Teachers, nor to any one man bearing eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office, to be the ordainer, or the ordinarie, as he ſpeaketh of the Miniſters of the worde. As touching the firſte, of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, the worde <hi>Ouerſeer,</hi> or as we call it Biſhop,<note place="margin">Actes 20.</note> is vſed diuers times in the Scriptures, but alwayes in regard of the people,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.1.</note> and of the Church, and at no time of other Miniſters of the worde. If it be otherwiſe, let him ſhewe where a Biſhop or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeer is named in reſpect of other Paſtours and Teachers. True it is that Paſtours &amp; Teachers may offende, through the corruption of nature, that is in all men, &amp; therfore are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted and freed by the worde of God, neither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouerſight, nor puniſhment, but are liable to all maner of cenſures of the church as any other of the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; to the ciuil puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the lawes, But their ouerſeers in ſuch caſes, are, the ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uil Magiſtrat, who is to ſee that they doe their duties, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to it by ciuill puniſhments, their cauſe being firſte duely heard, tried and iudged. Further, the Elderſhip of that church whervpon they attende, and all the greater Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferences and Synodes, wherevnto by good order agreed in the churhc, they are made ſubiect, haue the ouerſight of them, &amp; power to admoniſh, &amp; cenſure with eccleſiaſticall cenſures of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from their miniſterie, or of ſuſpenſion and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as their offence may deſerue. So as no man in the Churche, nor in the common wealth, is more ſubiecte to cenſure, excommunication, and other puniſhment then the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19103:64"/> Paſtours and Teachers: yea they are more ſharply in caſe they offende, to be proceeded againſt, then other men are, for the great offence their euill example, may giue to the wicked. But this ouerſight and power to cenſure them is not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God to any one man bearinge eccleſiaſticall office. For howe light a matter ſoeuer it be with Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops to ſuſpende many Miniſters from their preaching &amp; miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the worde of God teacheth another maner of proceedinge in a cauſe that concerneth the ſtaying of the preaching of the goſpell, which in higheſt degree importeth the honour of god and ſaluation of his people. It is vntrew alſo that he ſaith, that the Biſhop hath the ouerſight of the people, if he vnderſtande as I doubt not but he doeth, ſuch an ouerſight as by his owne power he may cenſure any of them. For the keyes, whereby is noted that power wherein the cenſures of the Church are contayned, are not giuen to any one man: Our Sauiour ſayeth not, if he that hath offended thee be obſtinate &amp; hearken not to thee, nor to the aduyſe of one or two witneſſes, tell the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of him,<note place="margin">Matt. 18.17.</note> and whatſoeuer he ſhal doe I wil ratifie it in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: but hee ſaieth, tell the Church, and if he heare not the Church, and ſo forth, plainlie committing this power not to any one but to many. To which purpoſe it is ſayd in the ſame place, <hi>Where two or three are gathered togither in my name, there am I amongst them and in the middest of them, ſaith the Lorde.</hi> Whereby it is playne,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.19</note> that they, who haue power to binde or looſe, are a companie, aſſembled togither by the ordinance of our Sauiour Chriſt, for that purpoſe, by meanes of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. In like maner to the Corinthes, the Apoſtle ſaith not of the inceſtuous, tell the Biſhop, that hee may excommunicate him, which no doubt he would, if as the Replier ſayth, he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bi hops for Cities and Dioceſſes, and Archbiſhops for Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinces (a fancie without all manner of appearance or colour) but, you being gathered togither in the name of Chriſte, &amp;c. appointing that by ſuch order as our Sauiour Chriſt had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,<note place="margin">1. Cor. <hi>5.</hi>4.</note> and with all their free conſentes, he that had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19103:64"/> that abhominable offence, ſhould be caſt out of the midſt of them. And if no man haue or can haue lawfully this power ouer the people, or the leaſt of the Congregation, how ſhould he be ouerſeer of the greateſt in it, which are (in regarde of their calling) the paſtours of the flocke. Nowe concerninge the being their ordinarie as he ſayeth, or ordainer, it is a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not agreeing to any man liuing, but in like manner belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to many. <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom the Replyer dreameth to haue bin a Biſhop, was ordayned to be an Euangeliſt by the layinge on of the handes of the Elderſhip, that is,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> the aſſemblie of the Elders: yea notwithſtanding the Apoſtle as it ſeemeth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> was preſent. And if the Apoſtle tooke not this power to him ſelfe alone, what Biſhop is he, that notwithſtanding hee bee bolde ynough to take it can with right and lawfully take ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to belong vnto him. And again, if the Apoſtle did not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this to him ſelfe to ordaine <hi>Timothy</hi> alone, ſure he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed neyther Biſhoppe <hi>Timothy,</hi> nor Archbiſhop <hi>Titus,</hi> (as it pleaſeth the Replyer, I thinke meerily according to his maner to call them) to ordayne Miniſters of the word by their owne power. Which further appeareth in that he willeth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to deale with that buſines as he had giuen him order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deale in it.<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.10.</note> To <hi>Timothy</hi> he writeth that hee had tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſeene and obſerued and knowne his maner of dealinge in the Church, and his courſe of life, which is commended in him to encourage him ſtill, ſo to followe his courſe and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as that he might in like maner both in the reſt of his life, and principally in the ſeruice of the Church gouerne him ſelf as he had ſeene him to doe before him in like cauſes. Nowe, <hi>Timothy,</hi> hauing ſeene this preſident and experience in his perſon of ordayning to the Miniſterie of the Goſpell, not by anie one man, no not by the Apoſtle, but by the aſſemblie of Elders, obſerued it no doubt, and was ſo taught by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation giuen him of the Apoſtle, not to bee th'ordinarie of any, as he ſpeaketh, or to ordayne anie Miniſters of the worde alone, though he were (I ſay not a Biſhoppe as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19103:65"/> imagineth) but an Euangeliſt. Which, it were nothinge to ſay is to be greater then a Biſhop or Archbiſhop, who are no body in the church by the ordinance of God, but creatures of earthly Princes: but greater then Teachers, Paſtors, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and next to the Apoſtles the higheſt degree of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie in the Church. And if <hi>Timothy</hi> an Euangeliſt could not doe it, then <hi>Titus</hi> whom he maketh but an Archbiſhop, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che at moſt is yet farre vnder an Euangeliſt could not doe it. And it is playne, that he is willed to deale in that ſeruice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtructions and order whiche the Apoſtle had giuen him for it, which can be no other then ſuch as he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed him ſelfe. And thus much for the ordinarie and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer both of the people and of the Paſtours and Teachers: with which point, his two argumentes to proue Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops to haue bin in the primitiue Church, are anſwered.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth his concluſion which is as glorious &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, as his premiſſes haue bin weake and ſlender. And ſhall we nowe (ſayeth the Replyer) dare to ſay that this office of Biſhop and Archbiſhop did worke a waye to Antichriſtes pride, and ſo forth, with ſundrie amplifications of the matter. Whereof the firſt is, that it is his iudgement (and he ſayeth he liketh his iudgement the better, becauſe Saint Paul was of the ſame minde) theſe offices were the beſt way to haue ſtayed &amp; repreſſed Antichriſtes pride, if ſayeth hee (referring to Princes their ſupreme gouuernement) they had accordinge to Gods worde directed their Conſiſtories, Synodes and Councells in all matters which are commonly called eccleſiaſticall. This is his firſt amplification, wherein he giueth the direction of all matters eccleſiaſticall to Biſhops and Archbiſhops. Hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in deede, according to Gods worde, placing it doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that it may be taken either that their offices are according to Gods worde: or that they ſhould in them, carie them ſelues according to Gods worde: But whether of both it be, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not: for, according to Gods worde, there is no ſuch office
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19103:65"/> in the Church as I haue ſhewed alreadie, and being no ſuche office, what intereſt can they haue whyle they continue ſuch, either to direct, or to haue any place at all in ſuch Synodes and Councells. So farre of is it, if the matter may bee ordered by Gods worde, that they ſhould cary all matters eccleſiaſticall. The Princes prerogatiue is notwithſtanding heere reſerued, which dependeth not vppon his reſeruation, but hath other ſuch certaine title to claime by, as the Princes are not to bee beholding to their Prelates for reſeruing them their ſupreme gouernement as of almes for them.</p>
            <p>Another point is, that not theſe offices, but the encroching of th'Archbiſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ouer all other Biſhops and Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops was the breaking of Gods ordinance and the way to Antichriſtes pride. <hi>Adoni-bezek,</hi> as we reade in the firſt of the booke of <hi>Judges,</hi> cut of the fingers and toes of 24. Kings, and put them vnder his table at his feete to geather the crommes that fell from his table, and the ſame iudgement after fell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him. Euen ſo ſome Paſtours caſt downe all other Paſtors &amp; officers of the church within a Citie or Dioces vnder them. After amongeſt Biſhops ſome dealt with his companions as they had done with theirs, and became Archbiſhops, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all the Biſhops in a Prouince, Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey or Region vnder them. Nowe, if amongſt Archbiſhops, there roſe vp one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence them agayne the wrong they had done to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe-Biſhops (if yet it may be called wrong, where at the firſte there was no right) what great cauſe haue they to complayne. When Biſhops and Archbiſhops cut of as it were the handes and feete of their fellowes, and caſt them vnder them, to gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the crommes that fell from them, did not they teache o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their example to doe the like alſo to them? Yea but (ſayeth he) the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roome</hi> would be higher then all his fellowes, and be Biſhop ouer the whole Church, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt. This was in deede the higheſt ſteppe, and euen the footeſtoole of the ſeate of Antichriſt. But, howe mounted hee thus hye, to come ſo neare ſuch a ſeate of pride, was not this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19103:66"/> way made by ſundrie ſteppes before, ere he came at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and was he not nearer and in greater poſſibilitie of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Biſhop with many other, then if there had bin none ſuch but all Paſtours like the elect Angells had kept their original? For as it was not poſſible for a man to lift vp his foote from the ground to any hye ſeate farre aboue his reach, but muſt goe to it by ſtaires and degrees from one to another, till hee come to the higheſt: So did Sathan in his miſterie of iniquitie make theſe ſtaires for the mounting of Antichriſt: whereby at the laſt, he ſetled him as amongſt the ſtarres. But this he ſeemeth to note as vnlawfull. And no doubt it is ſo. But, ſo were alſo the other, according to their degrees, which he would haue to be eſteemed lawefull But if the caſe were ſuch, as Chriſtian Princes did all receyue the Goſpell, and that a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell were helde, and to be continued, or renewed, as occaſion ſhould require, and Chriſtian Princes by conſent ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a moderator for direction of the Aecumenicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and name him <hi>Pope,</hi> or giue him ſome other title, noting his employment greater then of anie Biſhop or Archbiſhop, who are but, by the Replyers owne rule, to direct their Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and Councells of their Dioceſſes and Prouinces: what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception could the Replier take vnto this, why they might not ſo doe? After they had made this firſt ouverture, what can he alleadge why they might not, in regarde of vſing him to ſuch purpoſe, free him from the ſeruice of any particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that he might wholly attende vppon the generall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Church? And becauſe wealth, honour, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie may giue him the more credit, and for that Monarchie is the beſt kind of gouernement, and moſt eaſie and readie for all men, who beſt vnderſtande in it, their buſines requiringe, to whom to goe, and where to ſeeke their remedie: what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can he bring why it ſhould not bee lawfull for them all to doe herein, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent in all Chriſtendome, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is done in ſome, by any one ſoueraign Prince in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Or, if without all theſe, circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances the Princes nowe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19103:66"/> profeſſing the goſpel, ſhould agree that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn</hi> one of the Princes Electors, or any other ſhould haue, vſe &amp; exerciſe ouer all the Churches of the Goſpel, in what king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the chriſtian world ſoeuer, the ſame ſupreame power &amp; authoritie in all cauſes eccleſiaſticall that euer the <hi>Pope</hi> had, or exerciſed, and ſhould proceede by the ſame courſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Cannon lawe, as the Archbiſhop of Roome doeth with one onely promiſe, of diſanulling &amp; aboliſhing all ſuch Cannons as are repugnant to the lawe of God: what could the Replier alleadge, why eyther the Archbiſhop of <hi>Colleyne,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Archbiſhop, or Biſhop, might not by ſuch conſent, be made a Proteſtant <hi>Pope,</hi> and an vniuerſall Biſhop ouer all the Churches of the Goſpell, as the Archbiſhop of Rome by like conſent of the Kings ſupporters of the Keyes and armes of Antichriſt, is eſteemed Pope, and vniuerſall Biſhop ouer all Eccleſiaſtical cauſes within all their Dominions. What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can he make, why Princes ſhould not ſo conſent, or what aduyſe would he giue, if any Biſhop or Archbiſhop of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, were the man vppon whom they ſhould like to beſtowe this honour, from Epiſcopall or Archiepiſcopall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, to aduaunce him to Papall Supremacie? What a faithfull Paſtour ſhould doe in ſuch a caſe, is not harde to ſay. For it is cleare, that they ſhould doe as our Sauior Chriſt did,<note place="margin">Luke. 12.13.</note> when things not agreeing with his calling were offered and brought vnto him: Who refuſed to parte the inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene brethren,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.15.</note> who withdrewe him ſelfe from the people as farre as he could, going vp into an high mountayne, when they would haue made him a King,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.8.9.</note> and with deteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded the ſpeech of offer of all the kingdomes of the world and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the glorie of the ſame.<note place="margin">Iudg. 8.23.</note> They ſhould aunſwere with <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> when the kingdome, with the alteration of the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God had ſet ouer his people, was preſented vnto him, I will not raigne ouer you, the Lord your God, hee ſhall raigne ouer you, and gouerne you according ſuch order as he hath appointed. They were to aunſwere with <hi>Daniell, Your
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19103:67"/> giftes (ô Kings) keepe to your ſelues, and bestowe your regalities and honours vpon ſome other:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dani. <hi>5.</hi>17.</note> but I will declare the ſcripture, &amp; the interpretation of it vnto you. As the honorable oliue tree, the ſweete fig-tree, and the cheerefull Vine, anſwere in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of <hi>Iotham,</hi> that they would not leaue their precious fruit whereby they honoured,<note place="margin">Iud. 9.</note> delyted and reioyced God and men, to goe raigne ouer the trees of the foreſt: So ſhould a faithfull ſeruant of God and of his people anſwere, I will not leaue the preaching of the Goſpell, the miniſterie of the word, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring and reioyſing of God and man, with my precious fruite, to take an vnlawfull gouernement vpon me. This (I ſay) ought to be the aunſwere of a faithfull and true ſeruaunt of God, keeping his firſt inſtitution, as it was ordayned by our Sauiour Chriſt. But what other aduyſe the Replier could giue in ſuch a caſe to his friende, but to accept of the offer, and the ſame whiche the Bryar made in <hi>Jothams</hi> parable, whiche had nothing but a ſhodowe to boaſt of, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble and baſe ſonne of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> repreſented by it, which was, whether is it better for you that three ſcore and ten men rule you, or that one man haue the dominion ouer you, Come co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your ſelues with my ſhadowe, and if not, let fire come out of the brier,<note place="margin">Iud. 9.15.</note> &amp; conſume the very trees of Libanus. This muſt needes be his aduyſe in effect, except he can alleadge ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficient reaſon of difference, why there may not as well be a Proteſtant Pope, as a Catholike Pope, or why, all the reſt of the body of the Hierarchie that is in the Roomiſh Church, being in the reformed Churches, the head of it onely ſhould be wanting. For if it be lawfull to haue Miniſters, that by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all eccleſiaſticall cauſes in a Dioceſſe or Prouince, and the greateſt parte of a noble kingdome, as Princes that gouuerne ouer Counties, and Duchies, and Prelates, that reſemble the Lordes, Earles, and Dukes of the Empire, in the circuite of their gouernement, in their titles, ſtate, pompes, houſes, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, trayne, and liuing, they which allowe of theſe things, will hardlie finde any good reaſon, why there may not bee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19103:67"/> a chiefe Prelate ouer them, who may be the repreſentation of the Emperour. Peraduenture he will ſay (for ſome ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it he maketh in this place) this were vnlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a Royaltie that belongeth onely to our Sauiour Chriſt, to be the heade of his Church: but I doubt if they ſett vp their reſt in this cauſe, wholy, and onely vppon that reaſon, howe it will ſerue to keepe the Pope out of his ſeate, eſpeciallie ſuch a proteſtant Pope, as I ſpeake of, who ſhould vſe, or at leaſt in generall termes (notwithſtanding he obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little) be preſcribed to vſe no Cannons contrarie to the lawe of God, and who woulde eaſilie confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that his headſhip is not in any ſuch reſpect as it peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arlie belongeth to our Sauiour Chriſte, that is, by his owne right to gouerne, and direct the whole body of the Church, at all times and in all ages, but onely to direct as his miniſter and ſeruaunt, the Church of his age and time, in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters eccleſiaſticall, as by lawfull Cannons are referred from inferiour courtes by appeale, or otherwiſe to him as the chiefe miniſter. It is trewe in deede, that the further a man goeth from the firſt inſtitution, the more hee offendeth, and ſo the Pope, by the fulnes of the power he chalengeth ouer all, is further from the ordinance of our Sauiour Chriſt, who hath appointed in the ordinarie guydance of the Church no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to bee exerciſed by any one eccleſiaſticall perſon greater then is the office of the Paſtours, and whom hee hath made all equall in euery reſpecte of miniſterie, iuriſdiction, and of power. But otherwiſe, it wilbe founde that Biſhops &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, haue made ſuch a way to the Popedome, as it will be hearde, when they are come ſo farre, to keepe them backe with any great reaſon from the other. And thus much of his ſeconde amplification.</p>
            <p>The thirde hath no maner of reaſonable coherence with anie thinge that goeth before, and is ſo abſurde in ſence, as ſometime, I doubted, the Replyer coulde not bee ſo groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelie ouerſeene, as to haue written it in his originall,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:19103:68"/> ſo as by print it is deliuered vnto vs: but thus it is printed. For els (that is, except as he would fayne haue prooued a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the breach of the office of Bi hops and Archbiſhoppes were the way to bring in Antichriſt and not their office) why might they not as well ſaye <q rend="inline">that Chriſtes vniuerſall Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke or Archbiſhopricke did worke a way to Antichriſts pride and preſumption, becauſe he pretendeth, vſurpeth, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that kinde of miniſterie which is due and proper only to Chriſt. Chriſt is called a ſtone of offence, if Chriſte then had not bin the ſtone, none had ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled at him. Nay then if there were no Chriſt, there could be no Antichriſt: if there had bin no Archbiſhop, then the Archbiſhop of Rome had not bene Pope (for ſo I thinke he would haue ſaide although his words be otherwiſe). And if there were no vſe, there were no abuſe of any thing.</q> Thus farre the Replyer: wherein to paſſe by ſome ſpeeches that can haue no good ſenſe, and the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this inference, and that of all compariſons of thinges in heauen and in earth none could fitte him for this purpoſe but one, taken from our Sauiour Chriſt. I will onely anſwere the effect of his reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Declaration intendeth not, by ſaying that the chaunge of Gods ordinance made a way to the pride of Antichriſt, to ſay, that for this reaſon the office of Biſhops and Archbiſhops (in whom I thinke he rightlie gathereth it was meant the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God was chaunged, as it was in deede,) made way to Antichriſt, becauſe, if there had neuer bin any Biſhoppe or Archbi hop, then an Archbiſhop of Roome had neuer bin Pope. This is not the reaſon, whiche the Declaration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, but the reaſon is manifeſt in this, that by ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes there was made a chaunge of Gods ordinance, namely by bringing in ſuch offices into the Church. And then in depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo farre from the originall inſtitution of Paſtoures, as that one came to take vpon him the charge &amp; gouernement of thirtie thouſande, or fourtie thouſande Churches or more theſe chaunges of Gods ordinance, which were made in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19103:68"/> in theſe offices of Biſhops and Archbiſhoppes into the Church, made way to Antichriſt to come to his ſeate. For as the lower ſteppes helpe a man to come from one to another, till he come to the higheſt, and the higher euery degree is, the nearer it aduaunceth him to the top: So euery ſtaire that went from the Lords ordinance made way to other, and the hye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Biſhop and Archbiſhop, brought the man of ſinne very neare his ſeate wherein he was to ſitte downe and boaſt him ſelfe againſt God. In euery lawfull trade of lyfe, there are ſundrie degrees of preferrement, whereof euery one maketh way to other, ſo is it in the vnlawfull and Antichriſtian Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The inferiour degrees which Sathan had procured in his miſterie of iniquitie, did all helpe to aduance that ſinfull man to the throne of iniquitie. Whereby appeareth, that the very offices of Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops made way to that preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in what maner. Yet doeth the Replyer enforce this proofe ſo farre, as that he would haue theſe offices to haue bin and yet to be the greateſt impedimentes to the Popes ryſing in times paſt and to his preſent greatnes. Whereof hee allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth no other reaſon, but that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting his forgeries, kept him ſhort in <hi>Affrike,</hi> &amp; the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Rauenna</hi> kept him long tackling. The firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not true, for neither was there at that time he noteth, any ſuch Archbiſhop, as ſince haue bin &amp; nowe are in the church, neyther was that he meaneth detected by any one, but by the Fathers of the Councell. As for <hi>Rauenna,</hi> not he onely, but many other Archbiſhops and Biſhops, the Abbots, Priours, Colledges, namely the Colledge of Sorbone haue had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with the Biſhop of Rome ſome before he was growen to the Popedome, and ſome in the middeſt of his pride: So as, if Contention with that ſea, be a iuſtification of their callings, that haue contended with him, ſchooles of errour, and ſinkes of impietie, and moſt vnlawfull places and functions may bee iuſtified. This is yet enforced further, by compariſon with the order ſet downe for the guyding of the Church in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19103:69"/> as leſſe able to holde out that pride, then theſe his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are. In deede, if a man ſhould eſteeme theſe thinges by fleſhe and bloud, the enuie and ielouſie that Biſhops &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops may haue of the ryſing and greatnes one of another, and their worldly meanes, by fauour, wealth, authoritie, and ſuch like, to impeach and hinder their growing, might in that reſpect be a greater impediment. But, the continuance in the ordinance of God, had bin without all compariſon the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger meane, if we meaſure theſe thinges as they ought to bee meaſured. The Lorde by the weake things whiche hee hath choſen,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.27 28. 2. Cor. 10.4.<hi>5.</hi>6.</note> confoundeth the great things of this worlde, &amp; hath giuen his ſeruauntes furniture for ſpirituall warfare, which is mightie from God, to the ſubduing of euery imagination that exalteth vp it ſelfe againſt God. And therefore, to make way to this preſumption, it was needfull this ordinance of GOD ſhould firſt be chaunged. Yet is the Replyer bolde to ſay, that the order ſet downe in the Declaration might ſooner ſett vp a thouſande petite Antichriſtes, then pull downe one. For their pulling downe of one by it, I haue ſpoken, for the ſetting vp of any, it is not poſſible, this being as it is the inſtitution of our Sauiour Chriſt. And the inſtitution being ſuch, as that no one caryeth any cauſe, but all thinges are guyded by the conſent of a number, moſt fearing GOD, and of beſt abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for that purpoſe, which is moſt directlie contrarie to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, this vſurpation could not reaſonably bee feared. If there be manie Antichriſtes, as in ſome ſence the Euangeliſt Iohn fayeth, there are, and if all they who directlie oppoſe to the doctrine and ordinaunces of Chriſt be Antichriſtes, ſome great Antichriſtes, and ſome petyte Antichriſtes, as hee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them, from the Pope the toppe of all that Romiſh Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, to the reading prieſt, the tayle thereof, a man ſhould cleare but a feawe, I doubt, from that foule name and crime.</p>
            <p>Here is added an impertinent matter, that Archbiſhops nor Biſhops haue not brought in all kinde of falſe doctrine,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19103:69"/> although ſome Archeheretikes haue bin Archbiſhops, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius</hi> was. For ſo ſayeth he, alſo were ſundrie that were <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters,</hi> Prieſtes, or Elders, and Doctors. A needles point to touche, as the reſt which hee hath debated in this cauſe: the Declaration not charging any at all by name in this place, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops or Archbiſhops, nor by any iuſt collection, but in as much as in their offices the ordinance of God was changed, whereby way was made for Antichriſt, who brought in all kinde of falſe doctrine and confuſion. Not content thus to anſwere for them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no man impleaded, he entreth againe into compariſon betweene the offices of Biſhop and Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, and the order ſet downe in the Declaration, for the direction of the Church: affirming this to be more meete, as being of more learned men. Wherein to graunt where more are learned, there would be harder paſſage for falſe doctrine, he vtterly miſtaketh the matter to thinke that where that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he diſliketh, ſhould, or doeth take place, that there the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectours of Church matters, are, or would be vnlearned. The nature of the order it ſelfe, which admitteth no Miniſter but learned, nor any deciſion of waight, but by aduyſe of many, &amp; with appointed conferences and Synodes of learned men for ſuch purpoſes: beſides the aſſurance of Gods fauourable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his owne ordinance, &amp; the experience of the Synodes of the reformed Churches, the compariſon of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, Cannons, and other conſtitutions, with the like of the other in any part, beareth witneſſe, whether the wante of learning and pietie both, muſt needes be greater in it, then in the other.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the primitiue Churches preſeruing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning the order ſet downe in the Declaration. Nowe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the like of the beſt reformed Churches of this age. In the Replye wherevnto, here is an occaſion taken to enter into the whole cauſe a-newe, by making queſtion, whether the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nowe reſtored in the Churches rightly reformed, bee the ſame, that was exerciſed in the primitiue Churche. Againſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19103:70"/> which poynt he bringeth litle other reaſon, then he alleadged before. But ere he come to the repetition of thoſe arguments, he findeth great faulte, that the Declaration vſeth this ſpeach, that this order is reſtored in al rightly reformed churches. This title and name, he chargeth with open ſlaunder of many true Chriſtian, &amp; godly reformed churches beſides ours, for theſe are his words. <q rend="inline">Wherevpon, after his maner, he reaſoneth thus, ſporting him ſelf, if not rightly reformed (ſaith he) then wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fully, &amp; ſo not reformed but deformed, as hauing driuen out one Deuill by another, and remooued one deformitie to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe another. Would a man haue looked for ſuch a replye to this worde? but to pacifie his offence taken againſt right, he is to vnderſtande, that ſuch Churches are here ſayde to bee rightlie reformed, which are ſo, both in doctrine and in the order of the Church.</q> In which reſpect, would to God, all the Churches profeſſing the Goſpell were reformed. But it is playne, that notwithſtanding they be all in moſt and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalleſt poyntes of doctrine, yet ſome there are, not refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſome poyntes of doctrine, and more, not in the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall pollicie, and Diſcipline of the Church. Becauſe, hee onely toucheth this poynt, I am not willing neyther to ſtande longer vppon it. But, if hee conſider well with him ſelfe, the ſtate of all the Churches of the Goſpell, I thinke (as bolde as hee is, to bolſter vppe thinges that neede further refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) yet he will not take vpon him to mainteyne, that in all thinges, all ſuch Churches are rightly reformed.</p>
            <p>Before he cometh to his reaſons to prooue the order of the primitiue Church not reſtored, hee foreſtalleth the argument of the Declaration, before he come at it, taken from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite growing to the reformed Churches by this order, and the contrarie loſſe to others without it. But there is no cauſe to ſtaye vpon his replie to it, this matter being after fullie and at large debated by him, where ſhall be aunſwered what ſoeuer he hath materiall to this poynt: and becauſe there is little or nothing here worth the anſwering, moſt of this ſpeach being
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19103:70"/> ſpent in a tale or two out of Aeſope, Of a Dogge and a Foxe, with much gybing and ieſting vppon the ſame, matters fitter for ſome other ſtage then he is nowe vpon. For nowe he is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a Theatre where men and Angells looke vppon him: yea the Lorde bleſſed for euer, Amen. And where the Church eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie amongſt vs, attende to heare of him, whether it be in good ſtate, ſuch as may promiſe the continuance, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the bleſſing of God vpon vs, or in an euill eſtate and ſuch as may threaten the wrath of God, and ſuch grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmentes as in his anger he chaſtiſeth the diſobediences of his people with, if being warned and called vpon to reforme them, they doe not redreſſe nor amende them. Whiche pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and expectation, requireth a farre other ſpeache and ſtyle then is here vſed. Therefore, I wiſhe he may take this warning, hereafter to leaue this kinde of ſpeache, except hee will occupie him ſelfe with making playes, as he was wont to doe: but if he will deale with matters of grauitie and diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to intreate grauilie of them, and as becommeth a Diuine. Nowe let vs come to his reaſons. Hee argueth that the order of the primitiue Church is not reſtored nowe in the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churces: for his firſt reaſon, hee alleadgeth, that the offices of Apoſtles and ſuch like are not reſtored. Wherein, knowing his anſwere to be readie, that it is to be vnderſtoode of that order which was ſetled in the primitiue church to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, theſe being but temporarie and extraordinarie, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſelfe this anſwere, and then replyeth to it, that ſo were alſo the Elders whoſe office is reſtored, or if it bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that they were to remayne alwayes, why then did they not alwayes continue, but haue ceaſed ſo many yeres, till they were nowe in this age reſtored agayne. Wherevnto it is to bee anſwered, as he partlie teacheth, that moſt of the principall poyntes of the doctrine were not knowen, in the publike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the Church for many yeares, at the leaſt, not ſo, as all partes might take knowledge of it. I am not ignorant that there are many notable teſtimonies that in all ages, the trueth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19103:71"/> of Religion, was through the goodnes of God made knowen to ſome, and ſo was it alſo (I doubt not) in the matters of the Diſcipline of the Church. But as in the moſt publike and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant viſible Churches, in all partes, the holy doctrine it ſelfe ceaſed, and the true worſhip of God was turned into ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and idolatrie. So in the order and guydance of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, the right meanes and onely lawfull inſtituted and orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God ceaſed in them. This yet doeth not ſatisfie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer, becauſe he ſayth of the reſt, Paſtours, Teachers, &amp; Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, we are able to ſhewe that there were in all ages, good &amp; badde, why then ſhould not the like bee ſhewed of the Elder, if it were alike perpetuall. In which replye, it is by the way to be obſerued, that he acknowledgeth the perpetuitie of the Teachers office, and ſo good witneſſe to warrant it. For the continuance of theſe in the church, he did wel to ſhuffle good and badde togither. But, lawfull Paſtours, Teachers, and Deacons, ſuch as our Sauiour appointed to be in his church, where will hee ſhewe them to haue continued, I doubt not, but he will alleadge the popiſhe Prieſtes, Doctours, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons: but he is to remember, thar hee ſet downe in an other place, that the Churche of Roome doeth ouerthrowe the foundation, whiche hee declareth to bee Chriſt IESVS in an other place, without whom neither can any particular man bee ſaued, nor anie aſſembly bee the viſible Churche of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And if the church of Roome haue not bene for many yee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res a trewe viſible Church of Chriſt, then could not the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and other their Cleargie-men be true and lawfull Paſtors or officers in any place of the Church. This hee thinketh to take away with ſayinge, good and badde. In deede, if their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill had bene onely in lyfe, or in ſome one principall point of doctrine, it were ſomething hee ſaide. But, their defect was in the very calling. For Chriſt being the dore, and GOD that openeth to the Paſtours that enter by it, and all that enter otherwiſe, are theeues and murderers. What reckoning
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19103:71"/> can bee made of their callinge to bee lawfull, ſince the time that the doctrine of ſaluation by Chriſte IESVS, and by faith in him onely was condemned. But to deale more eaſilie with them, and not to bringe them to the triall of the worde which they are in no ſorte able to endure, and to iudge them by the Cannons: amongeſt ſo many as they were, where can hee ſhewe anye, for many yeeres togyther, lawefully called, accordinge to the beſt Cannons: whereby a dewe examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of learning and lyfe going before, the free conſent of the Church, whom it concerneth, and ordination or layinge on of handes by thoſe to whom it appertayneth is ſo required, as if default bee made eyther in the examination, or electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the whole action is diſanulled and made voyde. Nowe, if the Symoniacall compactes and bargaynes the brybes to procure fauour for benefices, the buyings of aduouſons and reſignations, whiche are generall miſchiefes in the popiſhe Church (And I would to God it might be ſayde they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there) and the agreede &amp; authorized default of due electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all, be compared with theſe Cannons: it wilbe founde, that for many yeares, no one of their Prieſtes hath bene by thoſe Cannons lawfully called. But if the manner of calling them were lawfull, howe vnlike are the offices and functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exerciſed with them, to thoſe which our Sauiour hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Their Prieſtes are ordayned not to preache the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, or to any other duetie of a true Paſtour, but to offer vppe Chriſt in ſacrifice for the liuing and for the dead. Teachers they haue none at all, but ſchoole Doctours, and created by the Popes writte, which is nothinge like the Teacher of the Church ſet in it by our Sauiour Chriſte for the worke of the miniſterie. A Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the firſt inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the liberalitie and bountie of the Church, beſtowed for the reliefe of the poore, ſuch as are in miſerie: whereof no ſhadowe appeareth in their Deacons, and I woulde this were onely trewe of theirs. Whereby appeareth, that in the Romiſh Church, if he meane that, as I take it, hee muſt needes doe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19103:72"/> he ſhall not finde in it, for many yeares, any lawfull Paſtour, Teacher, or Deacon, neyther by the worde of God, nor by the better Cannons that haue bin made concerning their calling: yet nowe the thirde time the Replyer helping him ſelfe with good and bad, tagge ana ragge, mainteyneth, that Paſtours, Teachers, and Deacons, haue alwayes continued in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: that by ſuch pretence, he might ſeeme to ſaye ſomewhat agaynſt the Elders office, becauſe, as hee ſayeth, it did not ſo continewe. But I haue alreadie ſhewed, this was no continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the holy miniſteries which our Sauiour ordayned, but other humane deuyſes and creatures of Popes, Archbiſhops, and Biſhops. Which yet, if it doe not content him, I may ſaye further, that this office of Elder, continued in ſuche ſorte, as he affirmeth the other to haue done. For, what were the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilians, Doctours, and Proctours, Chauncelors, Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Officialls, and the reſt of that traffique, Officers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taylers to the great Marchaunts of ſoules, Archbiſhopps and Biſhods: who, notwithſtanding they were lay men, did admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the cenſures of the Church without any due and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie eccleſiaſticall calling in deede at the appointment onely of their Lordes and Maiſters the Biſhops, to a foule profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy cenſure of the Church: whether it bee done in <hi>Babylon</hi> or in <hi>Syon.</hi> For this iniquitie alſo is to be founde euen in the Church of God. Yet, in their adminiſtration, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Elder, is as much, and a great deale more to bee ſeene, then true and lawfull Paſtours, Teachers, and Deacons appeare to haue continued in ſuch tagge and ragge, as were in the popiſhe church. But, the trueth is, that all Euangelicall charges, and the Goſpell it ſelfe, was deteyned in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and the free, right, and originall, nature, vſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of theſe offices ceaſed and was interrupted for a time, as the like hath come to paſſe in other ſuch waſtes and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, as in the time of ſome of the Iudges, in the raigne of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and in the captiuitie, the ordinarie offices and dueties were interrupted, and God extraordinarily
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19103:72"/> preſerued his people. All theſe things were for a time,<note place="margin">Luke. 20.9.</note> as the inheritance, in the parable of the Goſpell, in the handes and poſſeſſion of vniuſt and rebellious ſeruauntes. But nowe the Lorde ſendeth out his ſeruauntes, and demaundeth of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes that fruite, ſeruice and honour, whiche is due vnto him: with a part whereof he will not be ſatisfied, but will haue all his rightes and regalities, prerogatiues and offices reſtored vnto him, or els will puniſhe them as rebells and vniuſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. This is the anſwere I make to this poynt, whiche the Replyer bolteth out, in ceaſing by <hi>de facto, &amp; not de iure,</hi> and when he hath done, replyeth to it with an idle queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they were once, where they haue bin hidden or baniſhed all this whyle? or if they were dead and buried, &amp;c. not worth anie anſwere.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon why the order vſed in the primitiue Church ſhould not be reſtored nowe in the reformed Churches, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue no Biſhops nor Archbiſhops, whom he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue bin in that time, yea and ordayned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to haue authoritie ouer them, in the Regions and Cities limited to them. Whiche ſuperiour and olde ſtandardes to diſplace (ſayeth hee) to bring in yonge and inferiour Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as they, who hauing ſeene the olde temple did alſo ſee, the laying of the foundation of the newe: So would it make a mans harte throbbe and bleede, to ſee howe the beautie of the Church is vaded, hir ornamentes ſpoyled, her body haled, vnder pretence of reforming. This argument needeth no long aunſwere to it, hauing bin ſufficientlie ſhewed before, that it is a vanitie to thinke, that ſuch offices, as Archbiſhops and Biſhops nowe beare ouer the Churches, and the Miniſters of the ſame, to haue bin in that time. Here it may ſuffice, as it is but affirmed with a word of his, without any maner of profe, ſo to denie it with another, vpon the reaſons before alledged. As for his weeping to ſee the old ſtandards pulled downe, and the Church ſpoyled of her ornamentes, if hee meane hereby the manours and royalties that are in other mens handes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:19103:73"/> can he blame for it more then ſuch, as care not howe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours doe, ſo they may aſpire to the dignitie they couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and ambitiouſlie ſeeke and labour for. If hee meane not thoſe braunches, but the trees them ſelues, from whence they growe: let him conſider the bitter fruite they haue borne, and the vnwholeſome ſhadowe they haue caſt, from the firſt roote they tooke, and eſpeciallie of late: he ſhall haue no cauſe to weepe to ſee the axe making readie to be layde to their rootes. His harte ſhould rather bleede to ſee, in the garden of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie trees, wherein vncleane birdes make their neſtes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane beaſtes take their reaſt, and from whence the cleane are driuen for feare of annoyance, and which ſuffer no fruite or heauenly plante to growe vnder them, or neare vnto them. Then would he praye with the watchmen of whome <hi>Daniell</hi> writeth,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.11.</note> 
               <hi>Cut downe (ô Lorde) theſe great and noyſome trees, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are ſtrong to euill and not to good.</hi> Many a fayre tree hath the Lorde plucked vp, and, in time, it is to bee hoped, that he will doe the like to theſe, For our Sauiour hath ſaide: <hi>Euerie plante that my heauenly Father hath not planted, ſhalbe rooted vp.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 15.13.</note> His harte bleedeth to ſee the goodly leaſes that are drawen from Church-liuings, &amp; the great Lordſhippes that are gone from the Cleargie, and Cathedrall Churches, and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome other giftes, to ſee the diſpenſations whiche ſeeme to threaten the carying away of an Ile, and an Earldome, from ſome who would fayne enioye them ſtill. But whoſe harte is mooued with compaſſion of the people of God (whiche is in deede his trewe church) to ſee the worde of God daily taken from them, and they left as a flocke of ſheepe vpon the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes without their ſhephearde, to ſee the Preachers forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to preach the Goſpell, to ſee the church kept as in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, vnder a reading and lordlie miniſterie, that neyther teache the people them ſelues, nor ſuffer other that would to teache them to ſee goodlie aſſemblies, which haue made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth to ringe and reſounde agayne with the prayſes of God, ſcattred and diſtolued, to ſee the places like <hi>Eden</hi> the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19103:73"/> garden of God, before the ſtorme, layde waſt and deſolate as the deſert places, to ſee the zealous people of God running as in a drought, to finde a ſpring of ſweete waters, where they may quenche their thirſte, and faynting in their ſoules for want of it, ſo many fountaynes being ſtopped and ſealed vppe they that haue the bowells of Chriſt in them, are to be moued with theſe things. As for matters of griefe here mentioned, the matter is not ſo great, ſo that things be done by due order and with conſideration of ſufficient maintenance of thoſe which God hath appoynted for the worke of the miniſterie, of all the ordinances of God, and the edification and comfort of his people.</p>
            <p>Hitherto in this ſection the Replyer hath diſcourſed of the former ſorte of reaſons of this ſection, which is of the cauſes confirming the order ſet downe in the Declaration. Nowe he proceedeth to the other argument remayning, which is of the great fruite and benefite of this order in the Churches which haue receyued it, and the want of the ſame in ſuche as haue not yet reſtored it agayne. Wherein, firſt ſcanning vppon all, he denyeth the order of the primitiue Church to bee reſtored in all, &amp; alleadgeth for reaſon the differences amongeſt them in one point or other, of order, office, diſcipline, ryte or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Of all which, or any of them, hee giueth no one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. After repeating this agayne, in mention of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhe Church, he asketh, whether their gouernement and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their making of officers, and their adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, and booke of common prayers, bee all one with the booke which hath bin nowe three times exhibited in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. With this repetition, hauing gotten the aduauntage to make mention of a booke of common prayer: here hee reſteth and taketh this one example for all, to ſhewe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences amongeſt the reformed Churches. Which he would ſhewe by affirminge of differences betweene the Scottiſhe booke of common prayer, and the booke preſented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment written, &amp; the ſame printed at <hi>Middelborough,</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:19103:74"/> and at <hi>Scotlande,</hi> aboue three hundred differences, being a booke little bigger then an Almanacke. All which pointes, if they were true, what reformed Churches are theſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one from another, which he vndertooke to prooue. The Scottiſh Church is one, trewe, but where is the other, from which it differeth, except the other bee the booke preſented written in Parliament in Englande he nameth none. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bookes, if they haue ſo many differences, why did he not note, at the leaſt, ſome two or three of the principall.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible almoſt, for a man to write out one and the ſame copye oftentymes, or to print it, but that there will bee ſome ſentence, clauſe, worde, ſyllable, letter, tytle, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction changed. If the differences had bin materiall, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it were neuer ſo impertinent, I doubt not, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fallen into the mention of it, hee would haue taken payne to haue noted ſome of the principall printed copies of that which was written and preſented, he nameth three, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſhould be printed in three ſundrie Countries, <hi>Englande, Scotlande,</hi> and <hi>the lowe Countries,</hi> a matter of as much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth, as the reſt of his replies. As for the bignes of the booke of common prayer preſented in Parliament, which he, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace it, ſayeth, was the bignes of an Almanacke. I knowe not of what bignes he may haue ſeene ſome Almanacke, for all are not of one equall bignes, but if he would iuſtlie haue founde faulte with that booke, for being too little, he ſhould haue noted that it had wanted ſome poynt neceſſarie to be in ſuch a booke, eyther for publique prayers, or fot adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacramentes, or any ſuch like matter. But if it haue all ſuch things in it at large, there is no faulte iuſtly to bee founde with the ſmallnes of it. It might eaſilie haue bin grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it had bin ſtuffed with impertinent matters nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Miniſters office, nor warrantable by the worde of God, as with orders for priuate adminiſtrations of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, Churching of Women, Buryall ſeruice, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, making of Prieſtes and Deacons, Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19103:74"/> with a number of other ſuch like. But theſe, and ſuch like, being matters neyther warranted by the worde, nor ſette down in the auncient Lyturgies bearing the names of <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle, of <hi>Chriſostome,</hi> and of <hi>Baſile,</hi> nor in the Liturgie of the reformed Churges, it ſeemeth there was no cauſe to make it bigger with ſuch ſtuffe. A little point of a Diamond is more worth then a great deale of ſuch ſiluer as wee had at the beginning of her Maieſties raigne, and nowe (to hir high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes immortalll prayſe, and enriching of all the ſubiectes, with out anie offence for the innouation, and to the great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement of all men) is made finer, and brought to the ancient ſtandard appointed by lawe. Bookes, and namely of this vſe, are not to be wayed at the Kings beame, where they waighe packes and veſſels of great bulke and quantitie, but in golden waightes and ballances, where things of pryce and valewe are vſed to be wayed. A maſſe of owre and an ingotte of ſiluer or golde, are greater before they come to the furnace, but after the fyre hath tried and refined them, from droſſe &amp; baſe met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, the body of it is not ſo great, yet is it more ritch and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, then it was before. In like maner, that little booke, if it haue bin well purged and tryed, and oftentymes refined in the Lordes furnace, by workemen of skill, and faithefull in their ſeruice, notwithſtanding it be but litle, yet may be much more worth then ſome other of greater bignes and embaſed with much allay. No man findeth faulte nowe that a ſhilling is neere as little as a ſlyp-teſter was at the beginninge of hir Maieſties raigne, but rather acknowledged herein that hir Maieſtie hath deſerued all humble thankes of all hir ſubiects, with moſt faithfull duetie and ſeruice, to her highnes great prayſe and honour. Oh that it might pleaſe GOD, in whoſe hande the hartes of Princes are, as the Bardge is in the Bardg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, to turne whither he will, to turne this Royall Bardge of her Maieſties harte, towarde the Lordes ſanctuarie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well all things in it, and to touche the golde and ſiluer of it (which ought to be ritcheſt as the ſicle of the Sanctuarie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19103:75"/> was wont to be) and finding it, beſides all the abhominable droſſe that her Maieſtie through the goodnes of God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it, to holde yet much allay and baſe mettall: to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde it to be tryed and refyned yet ſeuen times in the fire, till all the ſiluer and golde in it, and the treaſure belonging to it, ſhould be fine &amp; precious, and anſwerable to the ſtandarde ordayned by the lawe of God, and the Temple of the Lorde in a ſpirituall maner, riche and royall as in the dayes of <hi>Salomon.</hi> Surely, if the Lord ſhould vouchſafe ſo to bleſſe vs, much leſſe cauſe ſhould any man haue to quarrell at the ſmall quantitie of the booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer or any other pieces of the holy treaſure and veſſells of the Sanctuarie being incomparably enriched in eſtimation and pryce, but rather ſhould haue more iuſt cauſe then for crying, Downe the bace money, and enritching our coyne according to a ſtandarde appointed by the lawes of the Realme, to acknowledge with all humble thankes and increaſe of moſt duetifull loue and allegance, a care ſo Princely, ſo Chriſtian, ſo agreeing with the like preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of her right noble Ancetours, hir Highnes Father and Brother, of worthie memorie, and hir owne religious &amp; moſt honourable beginnings, to the exceeding great encreaſe of the honour of Almightie God, hir Maieſties immortall prayſe with God and men, and the vnſpeakeable reioycing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of many thouſandes of her moſt loyall and duetifull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes. Therefore it is not the ſmallnes of that booke that can diſgrace it, ſeeinge that commeth of the taking away of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnneceſſarie partes, and ſeeing that it conteyneth all ſuch partes in it, as are neceſſarie and lyke to haue bin in any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie reported to haue bin within any time of fiue hundred yeares after Chriſt, or are nowe founde to bee vſed in anie of the reformed Churches. And thus much vppon the occaſion here offred of this booke. Agayne hauing thus anſwered the Replie to theſe wordes, all rightly reformed churches, I am now to proceede to the examination of his exceptions, to the frute alledged by the declaration to come of this order of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline preſcribed in tbe word, &amp; the want of the like where it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19103:75"/> is not receiued. The declaration herein ſaith, that the foreſaid order is now reſtored againe in all rightly reformed churches with ſuch daily encreaſe &amp; glory of the kingdome of Chriſte, &amp; ſuppreſſion of the tyrannie of Sathan, that the only experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, might be a ſufficient perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs to leaue this diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ordred ſtate of ours, wherein we haue ſo long labored with ſo litle profit. The reply to this, beginneth with a tale out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſops fables, of an Aſſe lode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſalt, which is vnſauorie, I dout not to the diſcrete reader, howſoeuer he wold make it taſt with his moral. I wiſhe he did as well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider <hi>Balaams</hi> aſſe &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof wherwith the du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be beaſt, ſpeaking with mans voyce,<note place="margin">2.

The next point in this reply is a matter of no coherence with that which was propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, of the frute of diſcipline where it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bliſhed, but a denial that we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to folow their examples herin: yea or that of the primit. church it ſelf, for theſe are his very words, which declare, ſaith he, what we may do, but bind vs not by any law or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles. Which becauſe he ſaith it is the very point he demureth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will ſhew him ſuch bookes for it, as he ſhall haue cauſe to ſay the law of god is cleare &amp; to demurre no more vpon this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p>To the Corinthes the Apoſtle ſaieth, in a matter that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a part of the gouernement of the Church: <hi>Jf any ſeeme to be contentious, we haue no ſuch custome, nor the Churches of God.</hi> Which I thinke, leauing the conſideration of it to the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, becauſe it is commonly taken otherwyſe, may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this ſenſe, that beſides all the former reaſons which he had vſed in that matter, they ſhould alleadge to ſuch as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, his contrarie cuſtome, and the contrarie cuſtome &amp; example of the Churches: meaning, that both hee in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and alſo all the Churches, ſo vſed that order of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde decencie in the preſence of the publike eccleſiaſticall aſſemblie, whereof he there ſpeaketh as he willed the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for to vſe it. In like maner doeth hee preſſe them with the examples of the Churches in another poynt of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, alleadging the ſame, as binding them to correct and reforme their abuſes, by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the good order in ſuch pointes which was vſed in other churches. <hi>Came the worde of God</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle) <hi>from you,</hi> or, <hi>is it come to you onely?</hi> By which wordes, the Apoſtle preſſeth them, as conſtrayned by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie example of the churches, to reforme their diſorders, except they would be ſingular, and eſteeme them ſelues onely wiſe. Wherein it is alſo to bee obſerued, that the firſt ſayeth, Came the worde of GOD from you, for notinge hereby the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> planted by t'haduyſe and counſel of the Apoſtles, he declareth, that other Churches were to caſt their eyes, as vpon all the churches that were at that time, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them ſelues like vnto them: ſo eſpecially that they were to haue care to be like the church of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> From which church, as the worde of God came, (as it was ſayde, <hi>The Lawe ſhould come out of Syon, and the worde of God from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 1.8.</note> according wherevnto charge was giuen to the Apoſtles to teſtifie of our Sauiour in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> firſte then in all <hi>Iurie,</hi> after in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and from thence to the endes of the world) ſo did alſo the Diſcipline of God, and the order appointed by our Sauiour Chriſt to be kept in all the churches: So as there
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19103:76"/> ſeemed the paterne to be, which all the churches were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was to expreſſe that which was ſhewed in the mountayne. To like purpoſe, in another place, the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayeth, ſpeaking of an order to gather for the churches of <hi>Jewrie: So I haue appoynted in all the Churches of Galatia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.1.</note> Agayne, by the example of other churches, vrging the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to that whiche was duetie for them to doe. All which teſtimonies prooue, that the examples of the churches, in that wherein they are ſet before vs in the worde of God to followe, and eſpeciallie of the primitiue Church, (whiche is by the Replyer expounded to be the Church of the Apoſtles times, and of their planting, whoſe example for that ende is reported to vs in the worde of God) doe binde other churches to conforme them ſelues vnto them. There were in deede ſome things extraordinarie in them, which are eaſie to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and belong not to our example. But that whiche was ordinarie in them, for the ſame reaſon it was deliuered vnto them, bindeth the churches of all ages to the like.</p>
            <p>Nowe, the holy ſtorie reporteth, that the Apoſtles them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and by the Euangeliſtes, ſetled the Churches, in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe wherein they were to continue, after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them. Whiche, for what cauſe all ſhould not bee bounde vnto, I ſee no ſufficient reaſon that can be alleadged. For, the reaſons for which ſuch order was giuen to them, were the ſame for which we haue no leſſe neede of that order then they had. There were ordayned Teachers in the ptimitiue Church, becauſe men are by nature ignoraunt of the will of God. Paſtours or Exhorters, becauſe by nature men are diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and rebellious, euen to the knowen will of God. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as watchmen of the Citie of God, becauſe there are daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers without, &amp; daungers within,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> that may hazarde the good eſtate thereof. The aſſemblie of Elders, that the ſolemne and publique meetinges of the faythfull, for the ſeruice of God, may be caried with a holy and reuerend grauitie, offences cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and fitt men appointed for the publike charges of it.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:19103:77"/>
            <p>Laſt of all, Deacons were ordayned, becauſe wee are to haue the poore alwayes with vs, and becauſe that God naming him ſelfe the Father and the protector of the poore, and enioyning his people to haue care of them. This ought principallie to appeare, in the publique aſſemblies of Gods people gathered togither in his name. Of all which poyntes, and of the reſt of the Diſcipline of the Church, what one is there, that wee, for the ſame reaſon haue not neede of, as well as they? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtande bounde to conforme our ſelues to their example. Which being conſtantlie and vniuerſally practiſed and vſed in all the primitiue Churches by order from the Apoſtles, &amp; for reaſons which concerne vs, as much as they did them, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to proue that ſuch examples of the primitiue Churche doe binde all later churches, although wee had no worde of commaundement otherwyſe to conſtrayne vs. But, becauſe he reſteth vpon this poynt, to ſee commaundements for theſe thinges, let him conſider that which followeth.</p>
            <p>The generall doctrines of the Apoſtles, whiche they taught the Churches to obſerue, doe ſo commaunde the churches, as in duetie and obedience of God they are to obey them: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is ſayde, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth mee, and hee that despiſeth you, or your doctrine, deſpiſeth me.</hi> But the Diſcipline of the Church is a part of the doctrine of the Apoſtles, whiche in generall appeareth by the 12. to the Romanes, &amp; the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and in particular, in the ſeuerall members and braunches of it, ſhall god willing hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Therefore, it is playne, to be neceſſarie by the Law and commaundement of Chriſt, that the churches keepe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline which was deliuered them by the inſtruction and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Apoſtles. Further, it is a playne commaundement of our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> 
               <hi>Tell the Church.</hi> Agayne, our Sauiour is ſayde, with charge and commaundement, that they ſhould be obſerued,<note place="margin">Actes 1.2.3.</note> to haue deliuered to his Diſciples ſuch things, as for the ſpace of fourtie dayes, he declared to them, concerning his kingdome. A part whereof (it hath bin alreadie ſhewed)
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19103:77"/> muſt needes be vnderſtoode to haue bin of the gouernement of his Church, which neceſſarilie dependeth on his kingdom. The Apoſtle likewiſe calleth the inſtructions which hee gaue to <hi>Timothy,</hi> for guyding of the Church, commaundements,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.13</note> and chargeth him with moſt earneſt charge and obteſtation, as he will anſwere it to God, who giueth lyfe to all things, and conſequentlie withdraweth it at his pleaſure, and to his ſonne Ieſus Chriſte, (by whom he will iudge the worlde) and who bare witnes to the trueth, euen vnto the death: that they ſhould be kept without any default, to that glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge againe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Further, of ſundrie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>This ſayeth the Lorde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.10. 1. Co. 11.23 1. Co. 14.37</note> 
               <hi>This I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of the Lorde, and theſe are the commaundements of the Lorde,</hi> with ſuch like ſpeaches. Which, being not alwayes ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the moſt weightie and principall pointes of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſufficientlie ſhewe, that which is ſpoken of them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to other, which are greater then they, or like vnto them. And thus much to his demurre vpon the poynt of the lawe.</p>
            <p>Nowe proceedeth he to the effectes and fruites of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, mentioned by the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be ſeene in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where it is eſtabliſhed, and not to be ſeene where it is not receyued. Concerning the firſt poynt, he maketh inſtance of the troubles of the reformed Churches, and ſuppoſeth, they would ſay Amen to him, wiſhing therein, as he ſpeaketh, good lucke, and that their caſe were no better then ours, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it were no worſe: which ſpeach is ſmallie to the purpoſe. For, the fruites of the Diſcipline, noted by the Declaration are theſe, the encreaſe of the kingdome and glorie of Chriſt, and ſuppreſſion of the tyrannie of Sathan: which is not diſproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by this reaſon, that they are perſecuted for the Goſpell, &amp; in troubles, but rather confirmed. For when was euer the kingdome of Chriſt more encreaſed, &amp; in greater glorie, then in time of perſecution? This glorie is in deede ſpirituall and not worldlie, but yet ſo truely glorious in the ſight of God &amp;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19103:78"/> his Angells, as all the glorie of this life is not to be compared to it.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.7.</note>

            <p>By all which places it appeareth that the glorie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, is not in outwarde things, but the glorie of his kingdome is in the conqueſt of ſinne, and of Sathan, it is in the preaching of his worde, the miniſterie of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and Diſcipline, it is in fayth, in the knowledge &amp; feare of God, in the obedience, conſtancie, &amp; pacience of his ſaintes. Theſe are not in deede orient pearles of the Eaſt Indies, but pearles of heauen, and golde and ſiluer out of the Lordes own treaſurie. And in this reſpect, Daniel in the Lyons denne,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> for calling vpon God, was more honourable then <hi>Darius</hi> in all his <hi>Perſian</hi> pompe and Maieſtie. <hi>Paule</hi> in his chayne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was bounde for the Goſpells ſake, was of more trewe honour with God and all that belonged to him, then <hi>Nero</hi> with his imperiall Diademe perſecuting the Church, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him ſelfe as a monſter in nature.<note place="margin">Matt. 27.29.</note> The crowne of thornes wherewith our Sauiour was crowned vpon the Croſſe, was in regarde of his obedience to God, in that kinde, incomparably more royall, then the crowne of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> vnder whoſe debite he was crucified, or of any other profane Prince, yea the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crowne of <hi>Salomon</hi> (a moſt wyſe, and at that time,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.11.</note> a moſte vertuous Prince) which his mother prepared for him agaynſt the day of his maryage. Therefore the glorie of the Kings of this worlde is one, and the glorie of the kingdome of Chriſte is another. The honour of th'one, is in worldlie peace, ritches, ſtrength and glorie: The honour of th'other is, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt reigneth in the middeſt of his enimies, when his ſworde diuideth the Father from the Sonne, and the ſonne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father: yea and a man from him ſelfe, parting the ſowle,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> and the ſpirite, the ioyntes and them arrowe. <hi>Doe yee thinke,</hi> (ſayeth our Sauiour, <hi>that I came to bring peace into the worlde,

               <note place="margin">Eſa. 60.18.</note> But by reaſon of th'iniquitie of menne, oppoſinge them ſelues to the worde of GOD, except all ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire togither with Sathan and his complices againſt GOD and his annoynted, to their moſt certayne and irrecouerable deſtruction, it can not be otherwiſe but that the zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and exerciſe of true Religion will bee mightilie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto by the vngodly, and ſo procure their great trouble and affliction in this worlde. This is the moſt ordinarie ſtate of the true Church of God, notwithſtandinge that it pleaſeth God ſometime to giue a little quiet. According wherevnto, if ſome of the beſt reformed Churches be nowe, and haue bene of many yeares in great troubles, and perſecuted with all ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trage and extremitie for the goſpels ſake, yet the kingdome of Chriſt may bee, and is, more glorious and more increaſed by them, then in other, which enioy outward peace, and vſe it not to the right ende for which it is giuen. In <hi>France</hi> the troubles haue bin exceeding great, by open warres, by pretence of lawes, by moſt vnchriſtian and barbarous practiſes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men that for wyſedome, valewe, and all maner of vertue and honour, were to bee reckoned with the worthieſt of the Earth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.23.</note> yet were ſlayne, as ſheepe appoynted for the ſlaughter.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19103:79"/> But yet is not the glorie nor the increaſe of the kingdome of Chriſt therefore the leſſe.</p>
            <p>The moſt precious blood of our Sauiour Chriſt the ſonne of GOD, was alſo ſpilt, and ſhedde as water, which was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to haue bene receyued by Angells in veſſells of golde, and his body caſt downe to the grounde, but not without great increaſe of his kingdome and glorie: for his blood became as the foure ſpringes that went out of <hi>Eden,</hi> to water all the earth, &amp; his body after it was caſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.24.</note> as a moſt precious ſeed into the earth, it broght forth more fruite then it had done before.</p>

Whoſe chriſtian preſident, both a crowned King, and alſo a worthie ſonne of that noble Father, haue followed, after that by terrour of as barbarous crueltie, as hath bin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any age, they had done otherwyſe then <hi>Daniell</hi> and the young Princes brought vp with him, did, in a caſe not vnlike to theirs, what ſhould I rehearſe other examples of that pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and honour of thoſe Churches, which might make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell and vnbeleeuer fall down on his face, and confeſſe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.24.25.</note> that vndoubtedlie God is amongeſt them, and in the middeſt of thoſe Churches. And this is the glorie of the kingdome of Chriſt, which the Declaration meaneth, may be ſeene to ſhine amongeſt them.</p>
            <p>His meaning was not that in them Chriſt ſitteth glorious is <hi>Salomon</hi> in his regall Throne, with <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James</hi> like great Princes ſitting the one at his right hande,<note place="margin">1. King. 10.18.21. Mat. 20.21.</note> and the other at his left. Becauſe our Sauiour anſwered them when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted ſuch a matter of him, that theſe are things agreeing to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19103:81"/> earthlie Princes, it ſhall not be ſo with you, but hee ſhalbe of greateſt honours with you that is greateſt in labours and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of others, for whiche cauſe they doe not affect nor deſire theſe things. Therfore, I conclude, that the prayſe giuen to the reformed Churches by the Declaration, &amp; namely to thoſe which are perſecuted with cruell and bloudy warres for the Goſpells ſake, notwithſtandinge all their troubles, is moſt trewe, and due vnto them, and that all this their bleſſed fruite and honor is of their entier and whole obedience which they yeelde to God in receyuing all the holy doctrine of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, both concerning things to be beleeued, and alſo concerning the ſpirituall pollicie, Diſcipline &amp; order, for guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Church.</p>
            <p>But yet, all the Churches thus reformed are not in like ſort as theſe are trauelled and purſued: but through the goodnes of God, ſome of them haue enioyed peace and quietnes for ſome tyme, and in it yeelde the like obedience and honour to God. So as the Replyer can not obiect continuall warres and troubles vnto them all. But of the ſtate of the reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, this may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>The wante of like happie fruite in our Church, for wante of like obedience in all partes of the Goſpell, the Declaration noteth after this, ſaying, that the former might be a ſufficient perſuaſion to vs to leaue this diſordered ſtate of ours, wherein we haue laboured ſo long with ſo little profite, and to imbrace that moſt beautifull order of eccleſiaſticall regiment whiche God ſo manifeſtlie doeth bleſſe &amp; proſper in our neighbours handes. At theſe wordes the Replyer is ſo mooued and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, as he wanted but <hi>Saules</hi> ſpeare to haue nayled <hi>Dauid</hi> to the wall. But I will proue if <hi>Dauids</hi> harpe may quiet and pacifie him agayne. Our eccleſiaſticall ſtate and policie (of which onely, it is as cleare as the light, that the Declaration ſpeaketh and of no other, howſoeuer he would wreſt it) is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in deede as diſordered. But, there are rebukes that are profitable, and of neceſſarie and excellent vſe, to thoſe who
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19103:81"/> are ſo rebuked. The Prophete <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing prayed to God, that he would not ſuffer his minde to be enclined to any euill thing, to practiſe matters by wickednes, with the workemen of iniquitie, yea, &amp; that he might not be taken as with a bayte with their pleaſant things: addeth further thus,<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.</note> 
               <hi>Let the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſtrike mee, it ſhalbe a kindnes, and reprooue me, it ſhalbe a most excellent oyntement: let him not keepe it from mine head, the more he ſhall doe it, the more ſhall my prayer be for them in their eu lls.</hi> By that he haue well hearkened to this, and conſidered of it, I hope he will not be ſo highly offended, for one worde, that ſoundeth not to his liking. Likewiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayeth, <hi>The woundes of a friende are better then the kiſſes of an enimie.</hi> It is alwayes lawfull to blame that which is blame worthie, ſo the reproofe proceede from the zeale of God, and loue of thoſe who are reproued. The Prophetes who moſt ſharpely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all eſtates of the people, and namely the prieſtes were they whoſe lippes were fined from earthlie corruption, and ſett on fyre with the coales of the Lordes altar by an Angell of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and whoſe mouth was ſanctified of God.<note place="margin">Eſa. 1.10.11</note> 
               <hi>Heare the word of the Lorde</hi> (ſayeth <hi>Eſay) yee leaders or Princes of Sodome, and hearken to the doctrine of God, ô ye people of Gomorrah: What haue I to doe with the multitude of your ſacrifices, ſaith the lord? I am full of the burnt offringes of the Rammes, and of the fatte of the fed beastes, and I deſire not the bloud of Bullockes nor of lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes nor of goates.</hi> And agayne, <hi>Their watchmen are all blinde, they haue no knowledge, they are all dumbe dogges, they can not barke, they lye and ſleepe, and delyte in ſleeping.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 8.10.11.12.</note> Likewiſe <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> ſayeth, <hi>I will giue their wiues vnto others, and their fieldes to them that ſhall poſſeſſe them: for euery one from the least euen to the greatest is giuen to couetouſnes, and from the Prophete euen vnto the Priest, euerie one dealeth falſelie. For they haue healed the hurt of the doughter of my people with ſweete wordes, ſaying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace. Were they aſhamed when they had committed abhomination? Nay, they were not aſhamed, neyther could they haue any ſhame, therefore ſhall they fall among
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19103:82"/> the ſtayne, when I ſhall viſite them, they ſhalbe cast downe, ſaieth the Lorde.</hi> If it be obiected that theſe Prophetes might liue in ſome wicked Kings dayes, wherein the holy worſhip of God was wholy ſuppreſſed, and ſuperſtition only &amp; Idolatrie tooke place: I anſwere: that they exerciſed in deede their Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office &amp; miniſterie in diuers kings times, whereof though ſome were wicked, yet ſome alſo were godlie, and ouerthrewe idolatrie, and ſett vp the true worſhip of GOD, yea ſome of them, namely <hi>Ioſiah</hi> and <hi>Ezeckiah,</hi> were the two rareſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for pietie and zeale that euer after <hi>Dauid</hi> were kings ouer that people: yet did no honeſt man (much les any true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete) eſteeme their moſt iuſt reproofe of the iniquitie of all ſtates, to be iniurious or derogatorie to the honor of thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kings, no nor anie of the Prieſts that did their duties. They were in deede hereby warned, as by the voyce of God, to looke to ſuch enormities, and to ſee them reformed, otherwyſe, they were to feele as they were threatened with the wrath of God, who would require it at their handes, if for default of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authoritie, whiche GOD for ſuch purpoſe had giuen them, notorious tranſgreſſions, chieflie in things belonginge to the ſeruice of God, were not redreſſed: yet did thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes honour and loue their Church, their Countrey, their Princes, and all eſtates of the people, as we doe, (the Lord bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witnes to vs, that we ſpeake the trueth) and as wee ought to honour, all lawfull authoritie and power, in the common wealth or in the church. In deed they had not ſworne Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obedience to any of their Prieſts, as the Replyer ſayth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſome of vs haue done, for this is an othe whiche God neuer commaunded, and howſoeuer it be ſuffered, if it might be duely examined, would be founde meete and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to be reformed, both in regarde of God, &amp; of the crown and dignitie of the Prince.</p>
            <p>But to returne to my former purpoſe, howe deare were the Churches of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and other places to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paule, who loued them to liue and dye with them, to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19103:82"/> deale vnto them not the Goſpell of Chriſt onely but euen his owne ſoule, yet howe ſharpely doeth he rebuke them? Was he therefore their enimie becauſe he did ſo, and tolde them the trueth? In the Reuelation Iohn writeth by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> without derogation to anie thing that was in good ſtate amongſt them, yea to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of that which was ſuch, but yet ſo ſharpely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them for certayne enormities that were amongſt them, as that he threatneth the remouing of their golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, and the goodly light of the Goſpell of Chriſt whiche ſhined amongeſt them. If then the writer of the Declaration haue rebuked in a worde the diſorder of the policie and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of our Church, in that good ſorte that is meete, or if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs doe the like, are we therefore (as the Replier woulde haue vs) not thankfull nor faithfull Miniſters to God, or not louing and obedient ſubiectes? We may (I hope) truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that we both feare God, and honour the Prince, and loue his Church amongſt vs, and are faithfull and obedient accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods word vnto both. But the feare of God, our moſt bounden duetie to our dread ſoueraigne Ladie the Queene, &amp; our zealous loue to our Church doe conſtrayne vs, to rebuke that which is reproueable by Gods worde: not to diſhonour our church, or any whom the ſtate thereof may concerne, but to procure the further reformation of it, and thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the honour of it incomparably more then euer hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both with God, and in all the Churches. I would to God we had cauſe to ſaye with the Apoſtle, <hi>We reioyce to ſee the ſtayednes of your faith, and the order that is amongest you.</hi> I would to God we might ſay, it were without ſpot or wrinckle, and might truely ſpeake of it all the moſt honourable thinges that are ſpoken of the Church of God, and ſaye, <hi>Jt is cleare as the morning, fayre as the Moone, pure as the Sunne,</hi> and that what els <hi>Salomon</hi> according to his wiſedome in his excellent Song commendeth the Church by, or any other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, or whatſoeuer the Apoſtles doe prayſe any of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19103:83"/> for, might be verified of it. This ſhould be our comfort and our ioye, our honour and our crowne. And therfore doe we not ceaſe by earneſt prayer and moſt humble ſute to God, and to the authoritie which he hath ſet ouer vs, and by all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie agreeable to our callinge, to procure the increaſe of the good and honour of it with all power. But it being ſubiect to a curſe, to call euill good, and iuſtly reprooued in former times, to ſay <hi>all is well,</hi> where GOD is diſpleaſed with many things that are not well, but neede moſt ſpeedie reformation; conſcience to God, and louing duetie towarde the Church ſeeme to haue moued the authour of the Declaration, to note that diſordre which he eſteemed to bee in the ſtate of our church, &amp; ought to enforce vs to do the like vpon iuſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>If all things be ordered according to the worde of God in our Church, then ſurely was the authour of the Declaration deceyued in iudgement, but in affection and purpoſe of hart committed nothing againſt it. But I demaunde, If by the worde of God, vnlearned men of all occupations and trades, be ſufficient Miniſters to take charge of the holy thinges, of Gods worde and Sacramentes, and of the ſoules of the people. Is the ſtate of the Church well ordered, whiche hauing the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable countenance of a gratious Queene according to the promiſe, <hi>Queenes ſhalbe thy nurſes,</hi> and great peace, large reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes for maintenance of learning, the benefite of Scholes &amp; Colledges, houſes of noble fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations for ſtudents, two ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Vniuerſities, of long time, for men of excellent abilitie in all good knowledge: &amp; all theſe helpes now almoſt 30 yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res togither without intermiſſion or interruption, beſides the former time of king <hi>Edward</hi> of noble memorie, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe is ſo vnfurniſhed of ſufficient and able godly learned men, as that by farre the greater part of it ſhould be in the hands of an inſufficient &amp; vnlerned miniſterie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any maner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent abilitie to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the word of god, without diuinitie, without ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, without art (other then ſuch as they were prentiſes at) &amp; in a great part without both pietie
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19103:83"/> &amp; religion. Doeth the word of God allow, that men called to the miniſterie may take ciuill callings, to deale by offices in cauſes of ſtate &amp; iuſtice, or to forſake the charge of particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations in ſeruing them in the greateſt &amp; higheſt ſeruice of preaching the goſpell to them, to rule ouer the churches &amp; miniſters of a whole Dioceſſe? Is it good order, allowable by Gods word, to make a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of miniſters at once, whereof no one is called or deſired to any particular Congregation, but muſt ſeke &amp; ſue for places after, where to beſtow them ſelues? Diſpenſations &amp; faculties for <hi>non</hi> reſidents, &amp; pluralitie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, &amp; a court of faculties for ſundrie like purpoſes, can it be iuſtified to be good order by the worde of God? Doeth the worde of God giue power to any one man vnder heauen, to make Miniſters alone, at his pleaſure to graunt licence to preache, and to call it in agayne at his owne pleaſure, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende, to releaſe, to excommunicate, to abſolue, and all as ſeemeth good to him ſelfe? The ſame worde alloweth not for good order, that Sacramentes ſhould be adminiſtred priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by anie, much les that it be ſo by priuate men, and leaſt of all by women. Nor that they be publiquely miniſtred without preaching of the word. It approueth not ſuch caſes of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as enforce theſe things, nor the doctrine of conference of grace by them for the worke wrought. To make that inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Sacramentes, that one ſhould haue power to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Baptiſme that ſhould not haue power to adminiſter the Lordes Supper, &amp; another power to adminiſter both: yet not to preache, and another to doe all three being the ſacred and hye ordinances of God, and yet not to confirme children, can not be ſhewed to be the orders or ordinances of God.</p>
            <p>In like maner can it not be ſhewed by the worde of God, that Chauncelours, Commiſſaries, and ſuch Officers of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Archdeacons, ſhould deale with the cenſures of the Church, hauing no maner of lawfull eccleſiaſticall callinqe vnto it, nor that excommunication is to be for <hi>pecuniarie</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and payementes of regiſtres, fees, or ſuch like.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:19103:84"/>
            <p>But what doe I reckon particulars, whereas, if the Cannon law be the rule for church-gouernement, the abuſes muſt needes be infinite. If theſe diſorders bee in the reformed Churches, notwithſtanding their wante of all outwarde meanes, and the heauie diſpleaſure of their Princes, and the whote and fierie perſecutions wherewith they are purſued, whiche yet were a time of tolleration and bearing with thinges amiſſe, if there were any, their ſtate were to be helde diſordered, and to neede reformation, for feare of the moſt iuſt wrath and indignation of God to fall vpon them. But if all theſe and ſuch like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be well ordered in them, and the ſame farre otherwyſe in our Church, notwithſtandinge all the meanes and helpes to haue procured the good ordering of them, much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenientlie then with them: is the Declaration to be blamed, for exhorting to leaue ſuch a diſorder, and to receyue that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is according to God? Nowe as the glorie and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt is highly aduaunced and increaſed where this obedience is giuen to him, to order his houſe accordinge to his will whoſe it is, ſo on the other parte, there muſt needes be ſo much wanting of the glorie &amp; increaſe thereof, where that obedience is not yeelded to him. Which would to God it were otherwiſe, and that the enormities of all ſortes did not ſhewe the want of that glorie of Chriſtes kingdome, that would bee if his orders were obeyed, nor the exceeding great apoſtaſie &amp; falling awaye from God to Atheiſme, Epicuriſme, and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenes, and namelie the multitudes of recuſantes of late yeres ſo greatlie increaſed, did not ſhewe how ſmallie the glorie of the kingdome of Chriſt doeth increaſe amongeſt vs. As for our peace and other bleſſinges whereof the Replier ſpeaketh, it is in deede to be acknowledged to the high honour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that neyther at this preſent is any Nation vnder heauen ſo bleſſed in all reſpectes, nor hath this Lande bin ſo at any time heretofore. The Lorde make vs thankfull for all his ritche mercies beſtowed vpon vs, and continew with great increaſes all the proſperitie and happie eſtate of our Lande &amp;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19103:84"/> people. But that he ſayeth, we are ſo bleſſed aboue all other churches, euen in this eſtate of eccleſiaſticall gouuernement eſtabliſhed, ſoundeth, as if he would haue one eccleſiaſticall eſtate, to be taken to be the cauſe of all theſe bleſſings. Some attribute the cauſe hereof to the troubles of our neighbours, and ſome to the gratious gouernement of hir excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and the great wiſedome of the right Honourable of hir Counſell, Diuines (as it beſt agreeth with their profeſſion, yet with due honour of all the noble inſtrumentes of this grace, as euerie one hath deſerued) to the prouident and watchfull care of Almightie God ouer vs, in giuing all the good meanes of this our eſtate which we enioye, and many times by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie fauours, diſcouering the ſecrete practiſes of our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and working in deede (as the Replyer ſayeth) wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and graciouſlie for vs. But, no man yet that euer I heard of, before this, attributed this honour to Archdeacons and Archbiſhops, to Chauncelours and Biſhops to Commiſſaries and Officialls, or the reſt of that trayne. This is a garlande would not become thoſe heades in anie ſorte, let them weare it to their great honour that haue deſerued it. Is it for that that they are the Officers which God hath ſet in his Churche, and therefore doeth powre his bleſſing vppon his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? It hath bin alreadie ſhewed what agrement they haue with the worde, and from what originall they proceeded. If it be ſayde notwithſtanding they be of mans creation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointement, yet they may bee employed in ſuch affaires, as might procure this bleſſing to the ſtate: let it bee conſidered wherein they haue bin occupied ſince her Maieſties raigne, &amp; it will eaſilie appeare, howe farre it is of that they ſhould haue any parte of this honour.</p>
            <p>If there were a commiſſion graunted, to examine what hath bin done by theſe officers, and their Courtes, for theſe nine and twentie yeares, what good they haue done, and on th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part what inſufficient Miniſters they haue made, what godly learned Miniſters they haue put to ſilence, and depriued
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19103:85"/> of their benefices, and other places of miniſterie, what cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies &amp; ſubſcriptions they haue vrged: what conſtitutions and articles they haue ſet out, and ſworne men to preſent, what conuocations and ſcenes they haue kept, what faculties and diſpenſations they haue graunted and taken, what cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſuſpenſions, &amp; excommunications, they haue ſet forth, howe manie, of what ſorte, and for what cauſes, they haue caſt into priſons, howe long, and in what priſons and order they haue kept them there, what oppreſſions and extortions haue bin committed, what couering and cloakinge of fowle and ſhamefull matters, with a number of ſuch like. I doubt not, but all men, that indifferentlie conſidered theſe things, would be conſtrayned to ſay: It is the mercie of the Lorde that wee are not conſumed, that the enimie hath not entred into the gates of Ieruſalem, euen for the ſinnes of the Prophetes, and for the iniquities of the Prieſtes.</p>
            <p>There are a number no doubt within the lande that feare God vnfeynedlie, his Name be prayſed for it. There are alſo ſome faithfull ſeruauntes of God, that kneele before him day and night, to be mercifull vnto vs, and to continue his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fauour towardes vs, the chariots and horſemen of Iſraell in deede. There are alſo a great number of godly ſtraungers, that haue left their countries, to ſerue God, where they maye bee ſuffered to ſerue him as he hath commaunded, by whom he hath ſet vp before all the people of the lande, a goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and example of that reformation whiche wee ought to proceede forwarde vnto, for whoſe ſake the Lorde may bee mercifull to vs, till he haue made readie ſome other place to lodge them in, or opened their owne countrey for them, to returne vnto agayne. But, which is principall, the Lorde for his owne Names ſake, and the prayſe of his mercie, vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth thus to bleſſe vs, that by his benefites hee might prouoke vs to that further duetie, of reformation of the Church, and obedience to his worde, which he requireth. Theſe and ſuch like cauſes of this our preſent happie eſtate, might haue bene
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19103:85"/> noted, if he would needes inquire into that matter. As for that which he alleadgeth to bee the cauſe of theſe bleſſinges, is ſo farre of from being any cauſe of them, as contrariwiſe, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not to prouoke the fierie wrath of God, to lighten &amp; thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, vpon all the ſtate of the lande and people, till hee haue conſumed both, as being the very roote and cauſe of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God that is in the lande, the nurſe and cheriſher of recuſantes and obſtinate papiſtes, and other heretiques, and in a word, of all the great iniquities and abhominations that are committed within the kingdome. And thus farre in anſwere to his reply to the concluſion, wherein the Declaration vppon former reaſons, concluded foure, and onely foure eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offices, namelie of Paſtours, Teachers, Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, to be appointed of God for the ordinarie guydance of particular Churches.</p>
            <p>This concluſion is enlarged by the Declaration, with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to ſuch as might thinke, in ſuch a treatiſe of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of the Church, the firſt poynt ſhould be, to ſpeake of the Magiſtrate. Which anſwere is, that becauſe the purpoſe of the writer is to treate of eccleſiaſticall gouernement, and that ciuill Magiſtrates are not eccleſiaſticall officers, but ouerſeers ſet ouer them to mainteyne them in the due executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their charges, and to puniſh them ciuillie, if they offende: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſemed more pertinent to the matter in hande, to ſpeake firſt of eccleſiaſticall officers, and then of the ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Soueraigne ouer them all.</p>
            <p>The Replie to this ſection is the moſt impertinent and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious that may be. For differing nothing from the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in opinion of any matter here directlie ſet downe, yet ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth he playing in a maner, vpon euery worde. A man would thinke the ſecond perſon, in charge of ſoules, in a whole dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, as he reckoneth him ſelfe to be, and hauing it, may bee, ſome particular charge. Beſides, if he would needes leaue all to attende vppon his buſines, yet ſhould haue bent him ſelfe to handle onely materiall poyntes, and that as ſoundlie, pithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19103:86"/> and brieflie, as he could, that hauing finiſhed it, hee might haue returned to his charges agayne, that Sathan, who goeth about continuallie like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whome hee may deuoure, haue no more aduantage of his abſence from his flocke, then the worke he hath ſet him ſelfe vnto of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie might require. But to ſee him thus diſcourſe vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeconde or thirde worde, and to playe and ſport him ſelfe, as if he were at great leyſure, and had as little to doe as one that ſhould playe with a feather: may ſhewe howe eaſilie men of his coate, beare the burden of the Church. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer his leyſure ſerue, if he can not employe it better then in ſo friuoulous trifles, as in great part hee waſteth the time withall, I thinke it meete, both for mine owne regarde, &amp; for the Readers, not to ſtande vppon aunſwering euery idle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but onely that, which of all his ſpeache may carie the greateſt ſhewe of obiection, to any ſubſtantiall poynt of the Declaration. For, hauing alreadie hitherto at large debated theſe matters whiche he often returneth vnto, as principall things in his replie, and ſtopt as it were the ſpringes and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of all his treatiſe, at layſure, and carefully, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to this place: the particuler poyntes, &amp; litle ſtreames that flowe from them, wilbe more eaſilie dammed vp. Nowe therefore to come to his replye to this ſection, whereas it is ſaide by the Declaration, as by way of an obiection. But while we ſpeake of eccleſiaſticall gouernement, it may bee thought that we ſhould firſt treate of the ſupreme authoritie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, and ſo forth. The Replyer after he hath played with the worde, <hi>whyle,</hi> diſcourſeth vpon the wordes <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall gouernement.</hi> Wherein he firſt anſwereth for hir Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to the papiſtes, and then ſheweth what hee taketh the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie to be, which is recogniſed by ſtatute to be in hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. Of which poyntes neyther the one nor the other belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth any thing to the matter in hande. For touching the firſt, there is in theſe wordes of the Declaration, no manner of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeake of the papiſtes, except he take it of the words,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19103:86"/> eccleſiaſticall gouernement, and for the ſeconde, concerning the expoſition of a ſtatute, it is fitter for a Reader in a houſe of Court, or for Iudges vpon the benche to ſpeake of, then for Diuines. Another poynt of as little valewe, and as vnſutable to the matter of this ſentence, is that he ſayeth, the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on attributeth amiſſe eccleſiaſticall gouuernement to Elders, except it be intended by eccleſiaſticall, that which any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the church. By which reckoning he would gather, that Wydowes are alſo church-gouernours, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration would haue women eccleſiaſticall perſons and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. Aunſwere to that he ſayeth of the Elder he nedeth none, alleadging no reaſon, and th'authoritie of the Apoſtle calling them Gouernours, is ſo weightie for it, as if he had put all the reaſons hee could alleadge into the counterballance, they would way no maner of weight againſt it. That which he ſpeaketh of Wydowes,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> ſheweth he hath not bin of anie long time exerciſed in theſe poyntes, but for ſome purpoſe hath drawen and forced him ſelfe. Now, to ſeeke an occaſion three or foure yeares after the publiſhing of the booke hee dealeth with, to be ſeene to be a Defendour of the preſent ſtate of our Church. For otherwiſe he might haue vnderſtoode that Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons are not accounted gouernours, much les Wydowes, but onely Paſtours, Teachers, and Elders, to whom onely the guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the publique ſtate of the Church belongeth. In the next place with as much agreement with the matter of the ſentence which he diſcourſeth vpon, as the former were, hee compareth Elders with ſyde-men &amp; church-wardens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſeemeth, he had before apprehended the matters ſo, as if none ſhould be eſteemed eccleſiaſticall perſons, but ſuch as were within ſome degree of prieſthoode, and had taken orders as they call it. But he vnderſtandeth it better nowe, for as hee compareth it, they are no more of the miniſterie then ſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Church-wardens are. The next poynt is of the ſence of eccleſiaſticall gouernement, if by it (ſayeth hee) be meant, that hir Maieſtie taketh vpon her to miniſter the worde and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19103:87"/> Sacraments (For that I take it he would ſay in his dark ſpeach) this is a ſlaunder of the papiſtes. If her gouernement in or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eccleſiaſticall cauſes, we admitte your ſenſe, and proceede to the obiection and aunſwere. I aunſwere, the Declaration meaneth neither of both, which are as farre from the matter ſpoken of in the Declaration, as if with his long wandring he had both loſt his way, and him ſelfe too. There was no cauſe, why he ſhould ſtand thus gueſſing at the meaning, the ſenſe being playne to be this, that in a treatiſe of eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, ſhewing th'order which God hath appoynted for the directing of his church, it may be ſome would looke ſuch a treatiſe ſhould treate firſt of the ſupreame power of chriſtian Princes. So as eccleſiaſticall gouernement is that, whiche the Declaration ſayeth to be appoynted of God, and neyther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the ſlaunder of the Papiſtes, nor his conſtruction: and therefore notwithſtanding that be not the ſenſe, it were time he proceeded to that which followeth. In the firſt ſentence of the Declaration wherein the foreſayde obiection whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere followeth, is layde out, the Replyer chooſeth certayne wordes to diſcourſe vpon before he come to the ſubſtance &amp; body of the matter contayned in the ſentence. According to which purpoſe of his, hee hath ſpoken firſte of, but whyle the two firſt wordes of the ſentence in this place of the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then of eccleſiaſticall gouernement, being of the next, nowe he proceedeth to the worde <hi>ſome,</hi> it being ſayd in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that it may bee thought of ſome, and playeth with ſome and many, and ſuch like ſpeache. After, it being ſayde in the ſame ſentence, that it may ſeeme to ſome, wee ſhould treate firſte of the Supreame authoritie of Chriſtian Princes, hee ſtandeth vppon the wordes Supreme authoritie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth whether it be ſo called by waye of ſuppoſition, or aſſertion: then reſoluing him ſelfe of the latter, he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth agayne, howe this agreeth with that, which was ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that all eccleſiaſticall matters are to bee directed onely
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19103:87"/> by foure officers of the Church, which he ſcornefullie calleth Tetrarkes. He might eaſilie haue diſcerned the aunſwere to this with a little conſideration. For the wordes of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are theſe: There remayneth of theſe before rehearſed onely in the Church, theſe eccleſiaſticall offices inſtituted of GOD, namely Paſtours, Doctours, Gouernours, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons: by which the Church of God may (accordinge to his worde) be directed in all matters which are commonly called Eccleſiaſticall. Wherein it is playne, that the Declaration ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuch officers as ſhould deale in their owne perſons, in preaching the worde, miniſtring the Sacramentes, executing the power and cenſures of the Church, and relieuing of the poore, and ſayth that of all the giftes and offices as Apoſtles, Euangeliſtes, and ſuch like which God gaue to his Church in the beginning, there onely nowe remayne theſe ordinarie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for directing and dealing in theſe caſes of the Church. Which although it be as farre of as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, from excluding the ſupreme power of the ciuill Magiſtrate, by the ciuill ſworde to protect or puniſhe ſuch as in thoſe callings acquite them ſelues well, or fayle in duetie, yet hee not only moueth this queſtion, but proſecuteth it in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hee demaundeth whether the Prince be one of thoſe foure, and if no, becauſe they are all eccleſiaſticall officers, and the Prince not, but a ſupreme Gouuernour, yet howe can they direct all cauſes and the Prince bee ſupreme Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, except there be ſome quircke founde out betwene direction and gouernement. And then they directing, and the Prince gouerning, according to their direction, they giue the name to the Prince, and keepe the power to them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, as the Pope of Roome dealeth with the Emperour, whiche were but a mockerie. But if they truely and vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly acknowledge Princes ſupreame Gouernours in all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cauſes, then ſtoupe gallant: all theſe foure eſtates are topſie turnie ouerturned. And then why yeelde they not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19103:88"/> to the eccleſiaſticall gouernement, by ſuch authoritie eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And if they haue the firſt degree in dignitie, why may they not haue the firſt place in the treatiſe, except the laſt place be greateſt with them in power as in Parliament the voyce of the Prince. And then a Gods name proceede on, let them ſay as the Gentlemen-Vſhers doe before Princes: On afore my Lordes, let all theſe foure eſtates take their places before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe our learned diſcourſers ſo aſſigne them. We will not ſtriue about the roome, ſo the right bee reſerued, yet no reaſon to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, but that they ſhould firſt haue intreated of the ſupreme authoritie of Princes, and after of the reſt, that ſo it might haue bin perceyued, whether they had encroched vpon their power or no. And this, me thinketh, had bin a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order then where all are placed, to ſaye, Your Maieſtie is come late, theſe foure are your Senyours, you are but their punyes, be content, you muſt take that whiche is left. And thus farre vpon the ſundrie wordes, and partes of the firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, conteyning the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is anſwered. To books which are full of ſuch matter as this is, may it be fitlie apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayeth, <hi>There is no ende of making them, and that they are a wearines to the fleſhe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 12.14</note> What fruite may there bee of all this waſt ſpeach, that is nothing to the purpoſe? and what a wearines is it, to followe one that runneth at no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne marke? The Magiſtrate is ſuppoſed to be wronged vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon no iuſt reaſon, and of a wrong ſuppoſall ryſeth a number of impertinent and idle queſtions, mingled with many vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie ieſtes, which are not according to his rule, that ſayd, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue with all authoritie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.15.</note> 
               <hi>and with a reuerend grauitie.</hi> If there had bin any ſuch thing in the Declaration, it would haue bin ſoundlie &amp; with ſufficient arguments diſproued by the word of God, and thoſe argumentes would haue bin layde forth in a graue reuerende maner, ſeemely to the callinge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who counterpleade one another, and agreeable to the action in hande, which concerneth ſerious &amp; waightie poynts of duetie to God, and the chiefeſt Magiſtrates he hath ſet ouer
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19103:88"/> men, and eſpeciallie as might bee ſeemelie before the Lorde him ſelfe, and all his Church, before whom theſe matters are debated: without regarde of all which due conſiderations, as he hath trifled vpon the wordes of this ſentence, ſo doeth hee likewiſe vpon the wordes of the next following. Wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it were a tedious idlenes to followe him from poynt to poynt: I will brieflie aunſwere the effect of all this part of his treatiſe which he hath cauſed to be ſet vp on the toppe of the pages in a diuers lettre, that it might be in the eye of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in theſe wordes, <hi>The Princes ſupreme authoritie ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Mine aunſwere wherevnto is this, that the wordes of the Declaration are ſo cleare and playne, as no man of ſound witt or perfect ſenſe can gather that it attributeth to hir Maieſtie, any thing eyther diſagreeing from hir high Honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, or vnſeemelie for a moſt loyall and duetifull ſubiect to vtter. For it is ſayde onely in the Declaration, that ignoraunt perſons, who thinke all things in the eccleſiaſticall ſtate ought to be diſpoſed by the abſolute power of the ciuill Magiſtrate, may ſuppoſe that a treatiſe of eccleſiaſticall gouernement, ſhould begin with the power of the Soueraigne. In whiche wordes, malice it ſelfe, can not with any colour finde, howe this ſhould attribute any thing inconuenient to hir excellent Maieſtie: of whoſe Royall perſon, ſtate, power, and dignitie, the Declaration in all places, and vpon all occaſions ſpeaketh ſo duetifullie &amp; reuerentlie, that except by the witneſſes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſayde, <hi>We hearde this man ſaye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 14.58.</note> 
               <hi>I can pull downe the temple of God, and rayſe it vp agayne in three dayes,</hi> or as honeſt men as they, the Declaration could neuer be charged vppon theſe wordes, to ſpeake any thing of hir Maieſties power, that is not godlie or not ſeemelie. Th'obiection whiche is made in the Declaration that the Treatiſe ſhould begin to treate, firſte of the power of the ciuill Magiſtrate, is ſet out, by noting thoſe, to whome this maye ſo appeare, namelie, ignoraunt menne that thinke all eccleſiaſticall matters ſhould depend vpon the abſolute power of the Prince. Which poynt is enlarged by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19103:89"/> oppoſing to them, other which are more moderate in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and referre onely indifferent matters to the Prince, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet it reckoneth not indifferent perſons in this behalfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would haue that without anie further inquirie to be helde indifferent, that the Magiſtrate or them ſelues ſhall account ſo to be.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Replyer paſſeth on to the other, whom the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration eſteemeth more reaſonable then the former, in that they giue onely indifferent thinges to the Soueraigne Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, if they did rightly iudge what were indifferent.</p>
            <p>This ſentence is as ſore racked by the Replyer, as euer was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie innocent Chriſtian man by the Fathers of the holy houſe of <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> or ſuch as were by them appointed for their torturing. No part that hath not felt the waight of his plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, no ioynt that he hath not vexed and ſtrayned. The ende and ſcope of this whole ſentence he would haue to be, to giue colome to the wrong done to the higheſt Magiſtrate, for not treating firſt of his ſoueraigne power. Wherein it appeareth, that neither there was, nor in reaſon could be ment, any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the high power of Soueraignes. For in all places where oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſerueth, no writing can be more reuerend, in ſpeaking of that ſoueraingtie appointed of God, then the Declaration is. And the order to be vſed by any authour, is not to begin to treate firſt of that which is the chiefeſt and hygheſt poynt of his treatiſe, but to begin with that which is moſt ſingle in his nature, and moſt common to all that followeth: that ſo hee may by his degrees, and due proceeding, come at length to that which is more principall. As in Grammer a ſentence is more worthy then a ſyllable, or a letter, and in Logike a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme then a ſentence or ſingle argument, yet the Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an beginneth not with his Syntaxis, but firſt with the partes of a worde, which are his letters, and ſyllables, and ſo proceedeth to the generall kindes, and after to the more ſpeciall, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, till at laſt he haue declared all thinges agreeing to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall and ſingle wordes, and then conſidereth of wordes ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19103:89"/> and framed togither in a ſentence. So the Logician be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth with his argumentes ſeuerallie and by them ſelues conſidered, then after of ſentences, wherein ſuch arguments are firſt ioyned togither, then of Syllogiſmes, wherein ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, laſt of all of the methode of whole Treatiſes, wherein all theſe ſundry things are examined. Which order, as nature and skill teache to be the onely way for a man to teach any thing in beſt order, and to moſt vſe of his Readers or hearers. And before this time, was there neuer, I thinke, ſuch an exception taken againſt it, by any man profeſſing learninge, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier doeth take, to charge this methode with ſome degree of leſae Maieſtie, and of treaſon. <hi>Aristarchus</hi> they ſay, when he founde a faulte in <hi>Homer,</hi> would marke it with his penne, and <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyrant for as litle faultes, would put men to great tortures. If there had bin in deede a faulte in the Methode, I perceyue the Replyer would not be content as <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> to make a note of it with his pen, but would bring a queſtion of Methode to the barre at the Kings bench, and arrayne it of high treaſon, and doe as cruell execution for ſuch an offence, as <hi>Phalaris</hi> was wont to doe for as little. But if he be neuer ſo earneſtly affected to purſue a fault in Logike, with fire and ſworde, yet it were great reaſon, he firſte vnderſtoode what good order and methode were, before hee condemned a man of treaſon, for the order of his treatiſe: but of this I ſhalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by his tantologyes and vaine repetitions, to ſpeake agayn. After the deprauing of the generall ende &amp; ſcope of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, he proceedeth to the particular vexing of ſundrie partes and wordes of it, which that it may bee better vnderſtoode, is here ſet downe as it is in the Declaration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Others there bee, with more colour of reaſon that referre onely indifferent matters to the dispoſition of Princes: but in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning indifferent matters, they ſhewe them ſelues not to bee indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Judges. For whatſoeuer ſhall pleaſe the ciuill Magistrate or them ſelues to call or count indifferent, it muste bee ſo holden of all men without any further inquirie. But of the ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:19103:90"/> of Christian Princes in eccleſiasticall cauſes, howe farre it extendeth by the worde of God, we ſhall haue better occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate hereafter, when we haue deſcribed the eccleſiasticall ſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he firſt ſtandeth vppon the worde <hi>others,</hi> with much tryfling and toying, ſeeking who theſe others may be, which in generall hee may playnely perceyue by the declaration of their opinion, that is, that thoſe others are ſuch as holde the opinion there declared. Next he examineth theſe wordes <hi>with more colour of reaſon,</hi> then theſe wordes, <hi>of indifferent matters.</hi> Whereof he would enforce the Declaration to affirme, ſuch others, to leaue all indifferent matters to the onely diſpoſition of Princes at their pleaſure. Wherevnto hee replyeth, that no good Prince doeth without aduyſe of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell determine of matters: notwithſtanding, he affirmeth the authoritie and lyfe of ſuch decrees, to lye onely in the Princes diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Salomon</hi> him ſelfe had his counſell: yet ſheweth he not by anie ſufficient authoritie or reaſon, that <hi>Salomon,</hi> or anie of the godly and vertuous Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> determined by aduyſe of their counſell, and commaunded anie ſuch matters of the Miniſters apparell, or any order, gouernement, ryte, or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in the Church, or what the Replyer may thinke to bee moſt indifferent in that kinde. Whiche had bin very fitte for him to haue done, the matter being of no ſmall importance, which he alſo ſetteth out to the vttermoſt, ſaying: <hi>That it is this day a great question, and toucheth the matter to the quicke, what the authoritie of Christian Princes is, in the diſpoſition of indifferent matters.</hi> Why then did not he, if hee would gage thus deepe into this veſſell, as to affirme all indifferent things to be, as touching power and authoritie, meerlie at the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Prince, alleadge vs ſome authoritie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes or Apoſtles, or ſome auncient Preſident and example of <hi>Dauid</hi> or <hi>Salomon,</hi> or ſome other of the godly zealous Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces and Kings of <hi>Iuda?</hi> But it was not becauſe he would like a graue and ſounde Diuine reſolue his Reader of this poynt, but for that, as he ſayeth, it toucheth the quicke, and might
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19103:90"/> ſerue him, to bring ſome man to queſtion of his life, as deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Supremacie, that he vrgeth ſo much this matter.</p>
            <p>Which yet as hir Maieſtie hath not at any time ſo purſued, ſo is it to be hoped, hir gracious diſpoſition, to religion and iuſtice, will not ſuffer hir hereafter to purſue, how clamorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſoeuer ſuch aduocates of iniuſtice, ſhall crye out, that it toucheth the ſupremacie. For ſo long as it is acknowledged, with all duetifull and godlie reuerence, of her Maieſties So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie, that the ſame power belongeth to hir highnes Royall ſtate, Crowne and dignitie, that at this time any ſoueraigne Prince vpon the earth doeth lawfullie exerciſe ouer his people, or any of the Kings of Iuda euer enioyed in their time by the word of God: although it bee denied that that fulnes of power which the Pope moſt vnlawfully vſurped in things, eyther contrarie to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of Amigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, or peculiar to our Sauiour Chriſt, can bee lawfullie chalenged by any Chriſtian Prince: Religion and Iuſtice will aunſwere in ſuch caſe that this is no more,<note place="margin">Luke. 20.25.</note> then as wee are taught in the Goſpell, <hi>Giue to God that which is Gods, and to Caeſar that which is due to Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Replyer here, rayſeth great expectation, in his reader, to looke for ſome reſolution, by the Declaration, concerning this queſtion, what the power of the ſoueraigne Magiſtrate is in matters indifferent: affirming this caſe to be moued by the Declaration, and therefore to haue bin thorowlie aunſwered, being ſo important, which is nothing ſo. For the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nameth no ſuch caſe nor queſtion, as to enter into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating of that matter, whiche would bee heere wholy out of place: but by the way, and vpon ſuch occaſion as hath bene declared, maketh mention of ſome vn-indifferent mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, concerning the power of Princes in indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. A vſuall thing in all good writers, and allowed by all men of ſounde reaſon and iudgement, by occaſion to touche a matter, without being bounde thereby, to enter into the diſcourſe of it. But if he were ſo deſirous to haue this matter
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19103:91"/> treated of, why did not he take this occaſion, to ſhewe vs, by the word of god, what the power of chriſtian Princes is in ſuch caſes, and to prooue, by ſufficient and ſtrong authorities, and other reaſons, that the ordinarie guyding of the Churche in matters indifferent, as well as in all other, is not lefte of our Sauiour Chriſte to eccleſiaſticall officers, that is, neyther to the particular aſſemblie of Elders, for a particular Church, nor for more, to a more generall, nor for the Church of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a lawfull Nationall Synode.</p>
            <p>He ſhould haue ſhewed vs by like proofe, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſoueraigne Magiſtrate, receyueth increaſe of ciuill power ouer the Church, by reaſon of his Chriſtian profeſſion and fayth. Then ſhould hee haue prooued, that if anie of the Princes whiche are Heathen, were by the mightie worke of GOD, conuerted to the obedience of the faith of Chriſt, hee ſhould not onely thereby ſtande charged to honour God with the lawfull and holy vſe of that ciuill power whiche hee had before his conuerſion, applying it nowe to the maintenance of Gods true ſeruice and ſeruauntes, protecting and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in well doing, as farre as his ciuill power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie may doe it, and enforcinge by the ſame power all men to that which by the ſame holy religion is duetifull for them to doe, as all other men are in like caſe to vſe their giftes of vnderſtandinge, knowledge, counſell, wiſedome, power and authoritie, or what ſoeuer, when they haue found fauour of GOD to bee conuerted to the precious faith of our Sauiour Chriſt: but that togither with the fayth, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth, beſides the charge of the holy vſe of the power whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hee had whyle hee was yet in his paganiſme, a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of power whereby hee may in matters appertayninge to Religion, appoynte and ordayne of all thinges indifferent, ſo as the aſſemblies of Elders, and Synodes, Prouinciall, and Nationall, are to leeſe that authoritie in ſuch caſes before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by them, and to render it vppe to that power, as of right and duetie belonging to it.</p>

            <p>But leauing the proofe of all, or any of theſe poyntes, hee complayneth, that by any occaſion this matter was once men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned by the Declaration, except it had bin thoroughlie debated: yet, leaſt he ſhould leeſe all his labour in ſifting and winnowing like wheate theſe wordes of the Declaration, hee laboureth to gayne ſome allowance from it of this poynt.</p>
            <p>Which is, that indifferent matters are to bee reſerued onely to the diſpoſition of Princes, which he would enforce in this maner. The Declaration, as hath bin ſayde, ſetting out the obiection of treating in the firſte place of the ſoueraigne power of Chriſtian Princes, with two ſortes of men and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, that may ſeeme to require the ſame, the firſte, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che referre all Religion to that power, and the other more reaſonable, which referre onely indifferent matters to their diſpoſition: addeth, that theſe men haue more colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then the other, but yet are not indifferent Iudges, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what is indifferent. Here vppon would hee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Declaration acknowledgeth this latter poynte for trewe, if they whiche mainteyne it iudged rightlie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie.</p>
            <p>Wherein, he is to conſider, that the worde <hi>but,</hi> whiche hee would ground vppon, is not to bee referred to the allowance of their opinion, but to the qualifying of their former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, as if it had bene ſayde, in referring onely indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent matters to Princes they are more reaſonable, but in determining what is indifferent, they are alſo to bee blamed: vpon that the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth, they are not indifferent Iudges, in determining what is indifferent, the Replyer asketh howe they can bee anie Iudges at all, if the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch things bee referred onely to the diſpoſition of the Prince. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he taketh that graunted by the Declaration, whiche is not grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, and diſcerneth not the word iudges to be taken here not in his proper ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by ſimilitude &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon: in which ſenſe many a weake chaplaine may be ſaid to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to iudge of indifferent &amp; not indifferent,

In which place the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is charged alſo as going about to take awaye from the Prince, ſome right that iuſtlie appertayneth to the Crowne, wholy without anie other reaſon but this, that the cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by it, might partake with our Sauiour Chriſt in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as in other, whereof it is ſaide, <hi>I payd or was charged with that, which I neuer tooke.</hi> For ſauing of the Prince from whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che wrong the Replyer verie ſoberlie, ſayeth hee dare hazarde thus farre of all good Chriſtian Princes, and will preſume by hir Maieſties leaue, to giue warrant for our moſt gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne that ſhe will not abuſe hir authoritie, nor hath done, nor would mainteyne or allowe them that ſo doe, if any doe ſo. What a needles palpable flatterie is this? Doeth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration call any Princes vſing their authoritie, into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If it doe, ſhewe in what wordes: if not, why doeth he take vpon him to mainteyne that, which the Declaration no where depraueth: but, as is meete in all Chriſtian duetie ſpeaketh reuerentlie and duetifully of it, where any occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerueth for that purpoſe: yet againſt all good reaſon and modeſtie, the Replyer concludeth this ſection, noting it alſo in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, leaſt any man ſhould not attentiuely take heede to it, that hir Maieſties right and doings are vnworthilie defaced. Neith r contented with this, he followeth this matter ſtill in his replie to the next ſentence, wherein he noteth a want of reuerence and duetie that the Declaration vſeth this terme of ciuill Magiſtrate, which is a worde both in Scripture, and all good writers, and dailie ſpeache commonly vſed, and he him ſelfe vſeth in this his replie oftentimes more homely, &amp; more vnſitting, then this is a great deale: yet is this, being ſpoken generallie, as in a generall treatiſe and doctrine, increaſed &amp; aggreeued by circumſtances from the perſon of hir Maieſtie, and alſo of thoſe whom he ſuppoſeth to haue bin authours of that treatiſe, or for whoſe ſakes it was publiſhed, whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:19103:92"/> to humble confeſſion of their fault, and crauing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſo great offence committed againſt hir Maieſties Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtate and dignitie, as in the generalitie of the ciuile Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, he ſuppoſeth the Declaration here to haue fallen into. For euicting whereof, he taketh vppon him to pleade for the Declaration, and to ſpeake what might be ſaide in the iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof, and after counterpleadeth him ſelfe agayne, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing ſuch poyntes as he thinketh to bee ſomewhat worth, to charge the Declaration in ſome degree with offence of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt nature: as if the tyrannous vſurpation of the Pope were noted in that ſacred ſoueraigne power by the declaration, and as if ſuch excuſe in that behalfe, as hee can affourde it, were but like the pretence of rebels, who notwithſtanding they ſeeke the ſubuerſion of the higheſt eſtates, yet pretende but to blame ſome neare vnto them. Loe the diſcreete wordes and charitable ſpirit of the Replyer.</p>
            <p>In deede I perceyue if he might appoynt the writer of the Declaration his atturney, his learned counſel, and his Iudges, or might be all this him ſelfe to him, he were like to receyue ſuch ſentence, as a whole court of iniuſtice might afforde. For by the title ſet vpon the toppe of ſundrie pages togither, which is, <hi>The Prince ſlaundred,</hi> and ſundrie other like ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in his margent, and in his text, to like purpoſe: it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth what ſentence he were like to giue in this matter. Of which crime if there hath neuer bin founde any guylt, nay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie colour or ſhadowe of a colour, in any of thoſe, in whoſe names the Declaration is publiſhed, no more then was in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>both,</hi> who was moſt innocent, although he were charged with like offence: then what may the Replyer differ from one of <hi>Nabothes</hi> witneſſes, who depoſed againſt him, that hee had ſpoken euill of the king.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hauing teſtimonie in our owne conſciences, and in the ſight of all iuſt and indifferent men, and which is principall, of Almightie God, who ſeeth the ſecrete of our hartes, &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witnes to our ſinceritie in this behalfe. I reſt well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herewith againſt all the falſe and ſlaunderous accuſations of all our aduerſaries, and ſo holde it needles to ſpeake anie more to this matter, howe often ſoeuer the Replier ſhal charg vs, and proceede on to the conſideration of ſuch other matter as in the reſt of this his firſt booke he hath layde before vs. Proceeding on with this ſentence, He rayſeth like hues and cryes vpon the declaration, for the wordes <hi>what pleaſeth them:</hi> after, <hi>for theſe, of all men,</hi> and laſt of all, <hi>vppon theſe,</hi> without all further inquirie, naming many idle queſtions, and pulling harde to ſtrayne this to reache to all politike matters. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect wherevnto he tendeth, is, that nothing is vrged for indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent amongſt vs, that is not indifferent, and that things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ſo eſtabliſhed as they are, all men ſhould reſt in ſuch determination without further queſtion. Which things he is content barelie to affirme, but it may appeare by the petition preſented to the Conuocation houſe for reſolution, that ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19103:94"/> godlie learned and faithfull Miniſters, not finding many poyntes ſo cleare as they are made in this place, deſired to be reſolued vpon what good warrant of the worde of God, they might reade in their publique miniſterie, Apocrypha bookes for Canonicall Scripture, and that for this reſpect, as more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying the church then ſome Canonicall, like aſſurance they deſired to haue for to reade ſundry moſt euident &amp; apparant abuſes of the holy Scripture, directlie in ſenſe and in wordes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the text. Likewiſe alſo how as indifferent or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the word, they might holde the reading miniſterie, the exerciſe of ciuill power in the Biſhops, and their ſo large and immoderate power in cauſes eccleſiaſticall, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the worke of their calling, and the ſeruice of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations, the iuſtifying of baptiſme by Women, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of neceſſitie for priuate adminiſtration of them, rytes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, and with ſignification of doctrine, beſides thoſe which are inſtituted of our Sauior Chriſt, an office of Deacon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all charge of the poore, and for reading of diuine ſeruice, and miniſtring only the one Sacrament of Baptiſme. Of theſe and many other like pointes debated at large both in that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and in the firſt part of this defence, they deſired to bee reſolued vpon what grounde of Gods holy worde they might holde them indifferent, or not repugnant to the word of god. And yet without any aunſwere to their peticion, without any warrant of the Lawe, eyther of God, or man: A ſubſcription is vrged vpon them, not onely as the Replyer ſetteth it down, but as it liketh him, whoſe it is, though it beare neither his image nor ſuperſcription, and ſometime in this forme, to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe faithfullie by it, neyther priuatelie nor publiquelie, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlie nor indirectlie, to depraue, reprooue, or reprehende anye gouernement, order, ryte or ceremonie eſtabliſhed, &amp;c. What cauſe therefore the Declaration hath to eſteeme ſome not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in ſhewing what is indifferent, appeareth by theſe Articles.</p>
            <p>Now whereas ſecondlie he would haue no inquirie of things
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19103:95"/> eſtabliſhed, let him ſhewe eyther that all thinges eſtabliſhed once by authoritie, are well eſtabliſhed, and ought without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie queſtion to be receyued of all: or els he muſt needes leaue it to the Church and to all the people of God, to examine and trye orders ſetled and eſtabliſhed by authoritie. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can not be prooued by any ſufficient or likely reaſon. For that were to continue poperie and paganiſme, and euery falſe worſhip amongſt men for euer. And to enforce men ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all inquire to receyue what ſoeuer religion, or matter in religion, is ordeined by the ciuill Magiſtrate: were to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ſtate eſtabliſhed, as abhominable an idoll, as was the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Image of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and exalteth Princes of the earth, aboue the heauenly King, bleſſed for euer. Therefore, he muſt needes leaue it free to the people of God, to conſider of the ordinances of authoritie. Which being lawfull, as it is, and not lawfull onely but alſo duetifull and neceſſarie, then, in caſe that any, eyther of the Miniſterie, or other calling, ſhal diſcouer any thing to haue bin otherwyſe decreed then by Gods worde appertayneth, it muſt needes be graunted, that ſuch in a reuerent &amp; duetiful maner may offer the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it to the higher powers: that reuiſiting their owne former actes vppon further knowledge of the will of God, they may amende and reforme whatſoeuer by the worde they ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne neceſſarie to be reformed. And thus farre to the effect of the reſt of his diſcourſe vppon the ſundrie wordes of this ſentence. The laſte ſentence of this ſection, wherein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration referreth ouer the intreatinge of the Supremacie till that be declared that concerneth Eccleſiaſticall officers, the Replyer, after hauing played withall a whyle, and ſought to make him ſelfe and his friendes merye with vnſeaſoned ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſpeache, without any grace of edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie anſwere, paſſeth on to the next ſection.</p>
            <p>In that parte which he maketh the next ſection, the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration firſt affirmeth it not needfull nor agreeable to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of teaching, to begin in that treatiſe: Firſt, with the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19103:95"/> of Princes, and after argueth it, by reaſon that that the Church was perfect in all hir regiment, when no Princes were Chriſtians, and at this day is in good eſtate, where it hath ſmall fauour of them. Wherevpon it concludeth, that the regiment of the church dependeth not vppon the authoritie of Princes, but vpon the ordinance of God. Which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion is enlarged by this, that god hath ſo eſtabliſhed the Church, that as it may greatly proſper with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable ayde of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magiſtrates ſo yet it may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue or preuayle againſt the aduerſaries of it, without that helpe. For the church receiueth helpe of the ſame to proceede more peaceably and profitably, but receyueth all hir authoritie immediatly of god. The Replier beginneth with the firſt of theſe ſentences, wherein it is affirmed, to be neither needfull nor orderly, in teaching, to begin to intreate of the ſupremacie, in a diſcourſe of this nature that the Declaration is of. And in this ſentence, he firſte vndertaketh to reprooue that it is ſayde not to be needfull. Wherevnto he entreth with an vntrueth, affirming the Declaration to haue alreadie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged for one cauſe of this order, to bee, leaſt the opinion of ſuch as giue the diſpoſition of all Religon, or at leaſt of all indifferent matters in religion to Princes, might be otherwiſe fauoured: whereas the Declaration made not mention in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſorte, of thoſe opinions for that purpoſe, but to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from them, to ſatisfie all men, concerning the order fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in that treatiſe. His reply to that the Declaration ſaith, it is not needfull to begin with the Supremacie, is in effect of no valewe, but yeeldeth to the iudgement of the declaration. For the Replier confeſſeth in playn termes, it is not needful as of neceſſitie, &amp; after alledging <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaking firſt of Magiſtrates, ſayth likewiſe, that that order is not ſo needful neyther that it ſhould preſcribe. Which if it be ſo, what a friuo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lous reply is this, when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing that to be true which is ſaid, yit he reſteth not in it, but will reply to it, and ſay ſomewhat to diſproue it. The colour he ſhadoweth this withall is, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it not needefull as in neceſſitie, yet that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19103:96"/> it ſhould bee needfull for conuenience, duetie, reuerence to the Prince, and to auoyde ſuſpition both of the Prince and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the rather for the prophecie of the Apoſtle Paule, 2. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie 3. and the experience of ſuch in the Papiſtes and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes. Wherevpon he concludeth, that in a treatiſe of the gouernement of the Church, next after Ieſus Chriſt, the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes power ſhould be ſpoken of. Which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, he renforceth with the example of the Apoſtle Peter, ſettinge out firſte, dueties to Magiſtrates, and after to Huſbandes, Wyues, &amp;c. Which argument is increaſed by this, that if the Apoſtles at any time did ſo, when Princes were not Chriſtians, much more ought it nowe to be done, when they are Chriſtians, and in poſſeſſion of their Supremacie. This is the effect of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, the reſt is but ſporting with like ſounde of needfull and heedfull, and needles and deedles, and a difference of his owne making, betweene needefull and neceſſarie, with ſuch like toyes. As for his allegations, if it were needfull for the reaſons he alleadgeth, it were in deede needfull to keepe ſuch order. But we denie that eyther conuenience, duetie, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Princes, care to auoyde ſuſpicion of the faultes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied to abounde in the latter time, the example of them in Papiſtes or Anabaptiſtes, or the preſident of Peeter bindeth herevnto. If it doe, then all they whiche haue not kept that order, which Peter doeth in that place, haue offended againſt all theſe thinges, which were moſt abſurde to acknowledge. For of the good Writers that haue written of the Church, how many keepe a diuers order from this. Surelie ſo many, as I thinke I may truelie ſaye, not one that followeth this order, which for ſo many reſpectes he holdeth needefull to bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And to attaint ſo reuerende a companie as there is of theſe, who haue written of theſe matters, of ſuch a number of the crymes he noteth, I thinke no Iurie in Englande woulde doe it, except he take them of the Hierarchie, &amp; of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, Proctours, Regiſters, and Sumners. The triall of our duetie and allegeance to the Prince ſtandeth not vppon this,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19103:96"/> whether in our bookes we firſt ſpeake of the Supremacie. Our ſeruice of hir Maieſtie in the places wherevnto wee are called, and our readines to ſerue hir, not with our trauell onely, but with our goods and with our liues, with our children &amp; with our friendes, doeth and will ſo teſtifie of our moſt duetifull loue and loyall deuotion to hir Highnes: as for a poynt of Logike, what order and methode we keepe in our bookes, we feare no preiudice of it, neyther with our gratious Soueraign, nor with any other, that haue but as ſmal a ſparke of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie grace, as the leaſt ſtarre in heauen ſeemeth to be.</p>
            <p>For the crymes of the latter age noted by the Apoſtle, and the accompliſhment of that prophecie in the papiſtes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtes, they could giue the authour of the Declaration, nor thoſe in whoſe names it is publiſhed, any iuſt cauſe to haue kept the order he liketh better. Not onely for that, if there were cauſe of ſuſpition of ſuch thinges, this is a poore aduyſe of his, for the taking of it away: but eſpecially becauſe they, whom this his ſpeach co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth, may truely ſay, I hope, God and man bearing them witneſſe herein, that they ſpeake the trueth, that they are as free from theſe crymes, as the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Surpleſſe or Rochet that he may be boldeſt to boaſt of. <hi>Pieters</hi> example is to ſmall purpoſe alleadged, as is all the reſt of this ſpeach, he him ſelfe confeſſing it not to preſcribe. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che if he did not confeſſe, were to be euicted from him by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie contrarie examples, both of Prophetes and Apoſtles. Whereof I will take at this time, but one or two for all, and ſuch as may fitte beſt that he alleadgeth. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſame exhortation he ſpeaketh of paſſinge from publike dueties to domeſticall and priuate, beginneth firſte with the dueties of ſeruauntes, and then proceedeth to the dueties of maiſters. And after in the Chapter following, firſte with the dueties of Wyues, &amp; then of Huſbandes. Whereby appeareth that his owne example, proueth directlie againſt him, that the order of ſpeache is not needefull to be, according to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of the perſons. Likewiſe, the Apoſtle Paule, in the like
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19103:97"/> argument,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.22.25. Chap. 6.1.4. Col. 3.18.19 20.21.22.</note> both to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> firſte exhorteth Wyues to their dueties, and then the Huſbandes: firſt to children, and then the parentes: firſt the ſeruaunts, and then the Maiſters: whereby it map appeare, howe ſmall a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell this is, and what good regarde the Replyer hath in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Nowe whereas he would enforce an argument, that if the Apoſtles did thus ſometimes when Princes were not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, much more ought it to be done nowe by vs they beinge Chriſtians, and in poſſeſſion of this ſupremacie: this may be of his refuſe, that he ſerueth vs now, For it is nothing worth. For it importeth not the honour or authoritie of the Prince one grayne, in what place of a treatiſe, their eſtate and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bee ſpoken of. Therefore, well might hee haue ſpared him ſelfe, and the Reader and the Defendant of the Lordes right in his kingdome, the good time that might haue bene better beſtowed, then about this vayne and friuolous cauill. The vnreaſonable groſſenes whereof is ſo much the more apparaunt in this, that the Declaration followeth in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtle Saint Paule ſteppe by ſteppe, who after that in the twelft Chapter of his Epiſtle to the Romanes, hee had ſpoken of all the officers of the Church in the beginning of the thirtienth, intreateth of Magiſtrates, and the dueties whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are due vnto them. This therefore may ſuffice him, for <hi>needefull.</hi> Nowe is it to be conſidered, what good reaſons he hath to oppoſe to the Declaration, ſaying alſo, that it is not agreeable to good order of teaching, to beginne firſte with this matter. But for reaſon, hee falleth to a reproche of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which he ſetteth out by compariſon of our old popiſh Archbiſhops ſtriuing for places. In deede many a bitter and bloudy bickering hath bin amongſt the Biſhops and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, whom he mainteyneth. <hi>Canturburie</hi> ſtriuing with <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> for the hieſt roome, and many ſuch like ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious quarrels, which hee had no cauſe here to mention, but that he would euen with his owne loſſe and hinderance of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19103:97"/> cauſe he dealeth in, rayſe ſome ſuſpition of the offices appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. For how ſoeuer he adde for caution, that this was amongſt popiſhe Archbiſhops, yet could he not without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of that grace whiche hee ſpeaketh of a little after, note their ſeates to haue bene the ſeates of fierie contentions, for ambitious roomes. It is not an vnconſecrate palle that can ſanctifie a man, but that proteſtant Archbiſhops may bee by their own faulte, through the iudgement of God, as wel heires to theſe diſgraces, as to the graces they ſucceede them in. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made a doubt, that ambition ſhould haue bin the reaſon of the order of the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he increaſeth it by this, that the Miniſters which ſeeke a further reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our church, can not abyde theſe names of grace, of honor, &amp; of lords. Whiche were a iuſt reprofe, if they did either in deed or word take that vppon them, which they diſlike in other, but the order of the declaration, in ſpeaking firſt of eccleſiaſticall officers, &amp; then of the ciuill Magiſtrate is farre from any colour of that ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for not abyding, as he ſpeaketh of theſe names, no man is ſo ignorant, but knoweth theſe termes to be lawful, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then theſe too, if they be lawfully vſed, as when they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to thoſe of the ciuill ſtate according to their degree. But for eccleſiaſtical perſons, which are not greater then Apoſtles, as none are, our Sauiour Chriſt hath expreſlie forbidden, that it ſhould be ſo with them, ſaying <hi>That Princes are called graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lords, but it ſhall not be ſo with you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22.25.</note> 
               <hi>but he that wilbe greatest amongst you, let him be your ſeruant.</hi> Whereby he teacheth, that the greatnes of a Miniſter ſtandeth not in the vſurpinge of Princelie titles, but in his greateſt laboures and ſeruices of God and of his people. Which thing the Apoſtle Paul well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode when as arguing this greatnes hee ſayeth, <hi>In la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours more aboundant, in perill often, and ſo forth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.23 26.</note> Therefore by the rule of our Sauiour Chriſt, the miniſterie moſt to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is that which preacheth moſt diligently, &amp; which labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moſt in the work of the goſpell: whiche howſoeuer men haue deuyſed to call it the inferiour miniſterie, &amp; the idle am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious prelacy the ſuperiour, yet by the rule of our Sauiour,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:19103:98"/> the honorable Miniſterie is that whiche is painfull in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, th'other which embraceth this preſent worlde, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoneth the preaching of the worde, is an inferiour, baſe, &amp; degenerate miniſterie, as litle regarded with our Sauior Chriſt, as it is highlie eſteemed with men: euen as it is ſaide, <hi>That which is high and glorious before men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 16.15.</note> 
               <hi>is abhominable vnto God.</hi> The reſt of this ſection concerning that Kings, Queenes, and Emperours muſt backare, and come after the miniſterie, is a matter that hath bin founde in ſome of the graces of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, examples <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> the proude Archbiſhop of <hi>Canturburie,</hi> and in his holines (moſt vnworthilie ſo called) next aboue them, but neuer any ſhadowe of it, in any fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter and Preacher of Gods worde.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth to aunſwere his replie to the reaſon of the Declaration, why to treate firſt of the Magiſtrates power in a treatiſe of eccleſiaſticall gouernement is neyther needfull nor agreeable to good order. Which reaſon is, becauſe the church hath ſtoode in the primitiue age of it without them. It doeth ſo at this day in ſome places, and may doe ſo hereafter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon it is concluded, that the regiment of it dependeth not vpon Princes authoritie, but vpon the ordinance of God, and conſequentlie, that in ſuch a treatiſe it ſhould not be needfull to treate firſt of them. The Replyers firſt quarell at this is, that the reaſon is not playne becauſe it is not in forme. For aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere wherevnto he is to vnderſtande that hee ſhall ſeldome find in any good Writer a Sillogiſme or reaſon in his full parts and forme layde out according to the exact rules of logike. The cauſe whereof is, that the writer ſuppoſeth, his Reader of ſo much vnderſtanding, that if any one part be wantinge hee may eaſilie be able to ſupplie it out of the reſt. When children are firſt taught to reade, they are holpen with a feſcue, which is after taken from them, when they are growen more perfect. So in Logike for the helpe of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rude and ignorant, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part is layde out at full, and in his order, when they are gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19103:98"/> to vnderſtanding it is preſumed they are able if any part be miſplaced, as it is in the beſt writers, more oft then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, or wanting, by themſelues to diſcerne it, and put it in ſuch order as it ought to be in. But becauſe he would haue it ſo, thus is the reaſon in his perfect forme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jt is neyther needfull nor agreeable to good order, to treate first in a treatiſe of the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church, of that power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out helpe whereof the Church hath bin gouerned in times past, is gouerned at this preſent in diuers places, and many bee ſo hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the power of ſoueraigne Princes is ſuch,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore it is neyther needfull nor agreeable to good order in a treatiſe of Church-gouernement, first to treate of their power in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another quarrell is, that the queſtion is not betweene the Church and Princes whether were firſt, but betweene eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall officers (which he in his play-ſtile calleth Tetrarkes) &amp; Princes, and ſo not betweene the whole &amp; a part, but betwene one part and another. And then (ſayeth he) if in an anatomie a man would firſt treate of the head, and after of other partes: or in deſcription of a houſe ſpeake firſte of the roofe, or that which was buylded laſt, he might orderly doe ſo. Wherein it appeareth, a man had neede firſte to haue reade and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Declaration to him, if his ſenſe be no readier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that which is written, and ſo plainlie layde before him. For the reaſon of the Declaration being ſuch as hath bin ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed what an impertinent ſenſe hath he deuiſed, making the reaſon ſo as that for the firſt ſentence of it he ſuppoſeth this. That which is in the regiment of it was perfect, before other is to be treated on before. In deede of ſuch a propoſition, no other concluſion could be inferred, but ſuch as hee maketh that is that the Church is to be treated on, before he ſpeake of the power of Princes, which were nothing, to prooue that which the Declaration intended. Yet as if hee had gathered this skilfully and like a good Logician, which it is like he ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19103:99"/> neuer thorowly learned, or hath forgotten many yeares agone. He ſtandeth a long time vppon examining the trueth of it. In which rouing although he be a myle from his marke, yet I ſee I muſt eyther followe him or giue him ouer. Firſt hee ſayeth, that vnder the name of the Church, it is ſet downe in this propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the fowre eccleſiaſticall offices of Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons, were before the Church: this is the firſt poynt he ſayeth is included in this ſentence. The next poynt he toucheth, is the multiplicitie and manifold ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of prioritie, which is time, nature, order or honour and cauſe, as he addeth after vppon better remembrance.</p>
            <p>Hauing made him ſelfe this way he beginneth to examine which of theſe wayes th'eccleſiaſticall officers of the Church ſhould be before Princes in the opinion of the Declaration, &amp; graunteth that in time they were before, but denyeth that in a treatiſe that ſhould be alwayes firſt, which is firſte in time: his reaſons for it, are theſe. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſo, deſcribing the maner how things began in the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet we are not tyed to this order, this is an obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt him ſelfe, whereto he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſlender anſwere. <hi>Caluin</hi> beginneth with the knowledge of man, &amp; ſo aſcendeth to the knowledge of God: If this exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple be regarded by him, then why doeth he charge the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with treaſon, for not treating firſt of Princes, when as <hi>Caluin,</hi> whoſe example he ſetteth for a preſident, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, was bolde to treate firſt of man and after of GOD, which in his diuinitie muſt needes be blaſphemie, if the other be treaſon. A thirde reaſon that Paule teacheth not the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes amiſſe, ſaying, that the inuiſible things of God beinge vnderſtood by his workes through the creation of the worlde are ſeene, that is, both his eternall power and godhead. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he meaneth that although God were before things created, yet he teacheth them not amiſſe to knowe God by his works. Wherein he hath forgotten that he vndertooke to proue that in a treatiſe, that which is firſt in time, ought not alway to bee firſt in place. Which if he had ſhewed in the Epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19103:99"/> to haue bin obſerued, although it were nothing to the Declaration, yet had hee hit his marke that he hath choſen to roue at. But in bringing vs for an example of a whole treatiſe, not halfe a treatiſe, no nor one whole chapter, nor half a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but one ſingle ſentence, he is farre from his owne marke he ſhot at. Such an other example of a ſentence out of the fourth to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he alleadgeth: whereto this aunſwere ſerueth. Laſt of all that the declaration maketh Elders before Apoſtles, &amp; yet place Apoſtles after in the treatiſe, which were nothing to his owne purpoſe if it were trewe. But that Elders in the Church of Chriſt are ſayde by the declaration, to haue bin before Apoſtles, is not trewe. This is his diſcourſe of time, fitter as a great deale of the reſt for ſome homely vſe, then to ſpende good time about. His next poynt concerneth priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of honour, wherein he reaſoneth wholy againſt him ſelfe, and for the Declaration. For his diſcourſe of it is to this effect, that that which is before other in honour, ought not alwayes to be treated on before, but may be handled firſt or laſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the preeminence of honour, which he exampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in treatiſes of morall and naturall philoſophy, and which is aboue all, in God, of whom he ſaith, that although he bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things in time, in honour and in all reſpectes, yet firſte or laſt may be treated vpon by good order of teaching. Which if it be trewe, why draweth he the Declaration to the Kinges benche, and enditeth it of treaſon, onely for that the firſt place of that treatiſe, is not of the power of ſoueraign Princes in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall matters? If it be no treaſon againſt God, but good order to treate of him firſt or laſt, is it treaſon ſo to treate of earthly and mortall Princes? O more then palpable flatterie! The Lord ſo direct all chriſtian Princes, and chiefly our ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Lady the Queene, to be ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing thoſe, that ſhal thus lift vp any fleſh &amp; bloud, aboue the liuing &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall god, as that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe they may ſeuerily puniſh thoſe that ſhall dare to ſpeake or write things, for pleaſing of them, that are ſo vnmete to be ſpoken and written of the hieſt Maieſtie.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19103:100"/> This ſhall be the honour of Chriſtian Princes, to endure no ſuch thing to be attributed vnto them, but to prouide that God may be honoured aboue all things, to whom onely all glorie and honour appertayneth. His concluſion of this parte ſhould haue bin that thinges are not neceſſarie to be treated vpon according to their worthines and honour, but hauinge forgot him ſelfe agayne, he falleth vpon the former poynt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie diſpatched of the prioritie of the time. The reaſon whereof ſeemeth to be, that by ſuch errour he might yet vent a newe argument concerning the neceſſitie of treating firſt of that which is firſt in time, which is that this is the papiſtes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for traditions. For (ſayeth he) they ſaye, that the word was deliuered by tradition, before it was written, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of no leſſe authoritie. If any man may make a chayne of ſande and cauſe it to hange by linkes togither, he may happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make ſome coherence of this argument, with the matter he is in hande to prooue. All the helpe he giueth the Reader to diſcerne howe this is to bee applyed to his purpoſe is this: The papiſtes encroch from the time to authoritie as our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren here doe. Where doe the brethren ſo? We are brethren with him in a maner at euery worde, but yet we are with him like papiſtes, like Anabaptiſtes, vnduetifull to Princes, nay traytours to them, and what not? Such brethren had <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who deuiſed to kill him,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.2.18</note> becauſe he tolde their Father of their euill deedes, as we diſcouer theirs to th'authoritie that is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them. Of ſuch brethren the Church complayneth by <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſaying: <hi>The ſonnes of my mother were angry against me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Canti. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed you were more naturall brethren then you are. But for the matter, where &amp; in what wordes doeth the Declaration gather any ſuch thing, not a little that ſoundeth that way. In deede he will needes force vpon them, that they gather ſo, becauſe they ſaye, that the Church was perfect in all hir regiment, before there were any Chriſtian Princes. But what authoritie is collected from this? yet if it had bin ſo, is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19103:100"/> euery argument proouing a thing to bee better, becauſe it is order, a popiſh argument. Doeth not our Sauiour reaſon thus when he ſayeth, <hi>It was not ſo from the beginning, but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was thus.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galathians</hi> directlie reaſoneth thus from the time, ſaying, <hi>that the Lawe which was giuen 450. yeares after the promiſe, could not make it voyde and of none effect.</hi> The places of arguments are as the light of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and the water of the riuer, common to all, whereof ſome vſe them to lawfull and good vſes, and ſome vnlawfull &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. If anie hereticke haue reaſoned from the cauſes, ſhall therefore the arthodoxe and ſounde in faith bee barred from vſing at time an argument from the cauſes. This is as ſimple a poynt in diuinitie, as he hath handled all this whyle in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike, concerning the methode and order of a treatiſe. If wee vſe their argumentes to the ſame purpoſe, let him diſproue it, which yet he and whoſoeuer taketh in hande the defence of the Hierarchie, muſt needs doe. For all their principal reaſons to proue Bi hops and Archbiſhops, are the ſame that <hi>Turria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and other popiſh writers alleadge for the Popes ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as in deede they muſt ſtande or fall togither.</p>
            <p>Thus at the laſt hath he done with the queſtion of methode &amp; order of a treatiſe, whereby it appeareth, (for all his double order of Syntheſis and Analyſis) that hee vnderſtandeth little more of it, then to ſweepe things togither, to make a heape of them.</p>
            <p>Now followeth his examination of this ſentence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that the Church of God was perfect in all hir regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before there was any Chriſtian Prince. This hee ſayeth is not trewe. For proofe whereof hee taketh a double courſe. Firſt, admitting that there were then no Chriſtian Princes, and ſo denyeth he that the Church was then perfect in all hir regi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment without them, vnderſtanding it of the ordinarie exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall regiment, and not of the temporary &amp; extraordinarie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of Apoſtles and ſuch like, His reaſon for this repeated infinitely in ſundrie confuſed queſtions ſhufled, according to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19103:101"/> his methode togither, is in effect but this, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ſhold ryſe no benefite nor commoditie to the church by Princes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing the faith of Chriſt. I anſwere, that this argument fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not: for the benefit may be exceeding great, as it is in deede in euery reſpect, when Princes become according to the Prophete, <hi>Nurſes and Fosterfathers to the Church:</hi> although the Church without them be ſaide to be perfect in all hir out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and ordinarie regiment. And firſte what reaſon he may haue to denie the ordinarie externall regiment of the Church of Chriſt to haue bin and to be perfect in it ſelfe before there were any Princes Chriſtian, let him conſider of this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. That ordinarie externall regiment of the Church is perfect, which proceedeth from our Sauiour Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. For in that reſpect he is ſayde to be our Lorde and to be the head of his Church, and to haue receyued all power both in heauen and earth. Nowe he that is a Lorde gouerneth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie and perfectlie his ſeruauntes, and the heade ruleth the body, eſpeciallie being ſuch a one as hath all power. But that ordinarie externall regiment of the Church whiche is meerely eccleſiaſticall, and conſiſteth in th'offices of ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as are eccleſiaſticall officers, proceedeth from our Sauiour Chriſt as Mediatour: For the adminiſtration of the Church, tending to bring all things ſubiect vnto God, and which ſhall be giuen vp in th'end, that God may bee all in all, proceedeth from him only as Mediatour and not as God, bleſſed for euer, in which reſpect he abydeth for euer. Therefore the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie externall regiment of the church, which is meerely eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, and conſiſteth in the offices of ſuch onely as are eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall officers is a perfect, ordinarie, and externall regiment of the Church. The power of Magiſtrates dependeth in deede alſo vpon him, but in regarde of his Deitie and Godhead, and not of the diſpenſation that was committed vnto him for our redemption. Further, euery thing is then perfect in his owne nature being ſeuerallie conſidered, when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of all the partes that are naturall, neceſſarie, proper, and eſſentiall vnto
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19103:101"/> it, and requireth not to the making of it perfect in his kinde any thing not neceſſarie nor eſſentiall to it, but of another and diuers nature. So euery creature in his owne nature, is perfect when it hath all ſuch partes and properties, as are neceſſarie &amp; naturall to it. The heauens, &amp; in them the Sunne, the Moone, the ſtarres: In the earth a Man, a Lyon, a tree, and ſuch like, are all perfect in their owne kinde, when they are furniſhed with all ſuch partes as are naturall and eſſentiall to them. To the perfection of the world in deed any one creature is not inough, becauſe the world conſiſteth not of one creature one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor of many, but of all, but conſidered in it ſelf euery thing is perfect when it hath all things requiſite to the conſtitution of his owne nature: which being ſo in all other things, muſte needes be ſo likewiſe in diuerſe ſocieties, powers and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſo as powers and adminiſtrations that are diuerſe are euery one perfect in their nature, when they haue all ſuch things as are requiſite for their nature. But the ciuile and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall ſocieties, powers, adminiſtrations and regimentes, are diſtinct &amp; diuerſe one from another. For the ciuile is of God only, it is onely temporall and ciuill: yea, euen when they deale with things eccleſiaſticall, yet is it but ciuilly, and is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by ciuill conſtitutions. The other is of our Sauiour Chriſt as mediatour, it is meerely eccleſiaſticall &amp; ſpirituall, &amp; euen in ciuill things dealeth but in a ſpiritual maner, and is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an eccleſiaſticall maner of calling appointed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt for that purpoſe. Further alſo in the time of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> as touching the ordinarie gouernement theſe two powers were diſtinguiſhed not only in perſons &amp; families, but in their tribes. Therefore being in ſo many and ſome other reſpectes ſo diuers, it is playne that the perfection of the one ſtate and power dependeth not vppon the other. For the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a people both in ciuill and eccleſiaſticall matters in deede, they are both requiſite, and the one muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the other, and helpe to the perfection of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to that ſame ende. But for their ſeuerall natures,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19103:102"/> eyther of them may be perfect in their kinde without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, And whereas ſo many ſtates of the heathen and other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious kingdomes haue bin and are yet at this day as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their ciuill eſtate and gouernement for that whiche is eſſentiall to the ſame, as any other where the perfect eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall regiment is receyued: Why of the other part ſhould wee not eſteeme, the ordinarie regiment appointed for the church to be perfect in it ſelfe without the ciuill. Wereby it is not to be vnderſtoode that the eccleſiaſticall gouernement is perfect without the ciuill, ſo as the ciuill Magiſtrate ſhould not bee needefull for gouernement of the people, but the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſo perfect, as for all purpoſes, it onely ſhould be needfull. For the power of the Magiſtrat is moſt needfull in his kinde: although the regiment of the Church be neuer ſo perfect, that is as touching the ordinances and lawes whereby it ſhould be ruled, neuer ſo agreeable to the worde of god: yea &amp; although the Magiſtrate were not Chriſtian, and much more if hee bee chriſtian. Becauſe the people of God hauing bodyes &amp; goods as well as ſoules and ſpirituall benefites, ſtande in neede of a ciuill power to protect and defende them with an arme of fleſhe and bloud from iniuries in that kinde, and to mainteine them for the things that properlie concerne this life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a courſe agreeable to entertayne &amp; preſerue the good eſtate thereof. Whiche is not onely of men whoſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities enforce them herevnto: but it is ſo th'ordinance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. But for eccleſiaſticall gouernement and th'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of things which belong to that power, the order appointed by our Sauiour Chriſt is ſufficient and perfect. This may beſt appeare in the gouernement of the people of God amongeſt the Iewes, wherein God him ſelfe ordeined not onely both powers, but appoynted ſeuerall lawes and perſons for th'adminiſtration of them: both which being of God, and moſt perfect in euery reſpect, it muſt needes be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, that eyther was perfect in his kinde, and for ſuch purpoſe as hee had appoynted them. To the good gouernement of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19103:102"/> for all purpoſes both powers were neceſſarie, and neyther the ciuill perfect without the eccleſiaſticall, nor the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call without the ciuill, but eyther of them perfect for that end and purpoſe, for which eyther was appointed of God.</p>
            <p>Nowe our Sauiour Chriſt, altering the forme of the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall gouernement, and ſo much of the ciuile as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon it, or onely concerned that people, is to be thought to haue giuen as an adminiſtration of his church, no leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for like vſe then that was, which before was giuen to the Fathers. Wherevppon it followeth that the ordinarie eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall gouernement of the Church was perfect before there were any Princes become Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, th'ordinarie externall adminiſtration and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches is then perfect, when all ordinarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall things belonging to the Church haue their officers &amp; orders meete for the due adminiſtration of them. But the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church before there were any ſoueraigne Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, had their officers and orders meete for all the ordinarie and externall regiment of the Church. For what is belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the outward ordinarie regiment of the church. But the miniſterie of the worde, of the Sacramentes, of the Diſcipline, and the reliefe of the poore. For all whiche vſes the primitiue Church was ſufficientlie and perfectlie furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, hauing Paſtours, Teachers, Elders, &amp; Deacons. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as the Church of Ieruſalem is a perfect preſident, and the reſt of the Churches, planted by the Apoſtles: ſo was namely that of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced to ſee the ſtayednes of their faith, and the order that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them.</hi> If it had bin otherwiſe, the church for the ſpace of about 300. yeares ſhould haue bin left vnperfect, beinge without anie perfect ordinarie extetnall regiment for ſo long time, and that alſo ſuch, as moſt of all required ſuch an order by reaſon of the perſecutions: which could not ſtande with the wiſedome and loue of our Sauiour Chriſte towardes his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19103:103"/> church. As it can not ſtande with his office of Mediatour, that to the perfection of the outwarde ordinarie regiment of the Church there ſhould be requiſite any other officers then ſuch as he by vertue of that office appointed, which are only eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall officers, as hath bin ſaide, the temporall powers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordayned by him onely as God and not depending of his office of mediation and redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mankind. When he did ſo bleſſe his people as that both the ciuill &amp; eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement procedde immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe: yet was eyther of theſe perfect in their kinde, &amp; for ſuch vſe as they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed without the other, which appeared in the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call regiment as in other ages, ſo in the times of <hi>Phineas</hi> and <hi>Jehoiada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For concluſion of this poynt I adde, that ſuch outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie regiment of the Church muſt needes bee perfect as is eſtabliſhed according to all the commaundements and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of our Sauiour Chriſt, and ſuch as ſufficeth for the due, full and perfect execution of them, and whiche bringeth theſe who are gouerned by it, to hyeſt perſecution, namelie to the ſaluation of their ſoules. But all theſe things did the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ordinarie regiment of the primitiue Church performe before there were any Chriſtian Princes. Therefore, before ſuch time the outwarde ordinarie regiment of the Churche was perfect.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſeconde poynt, that notwithſtanding the outwarde ordinarie regiment of the Church was perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Princes became Chriſtians, that followeth not therefore that the Church hath no benefite, helpe nor comfort by their conuerſion to the faith of Chriſt, but is to bee acknowledged, that exceeding great and gracious is the fauour whiche GOD doeth to his Church when Princes are ioyned to it.</p>
            <p>The outwarde ordinarie regiment of the Church for the time of the Lawe (which was ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mount, according to which he was commaunded to ſee all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and is ſaide to haue accompliſhed it accordinglie)
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19103:103"/> was ſo perfect as proceeding immediatlie from God wholy &amp; onely perfect, could not bee made any more perfect by anie creature whatſoeuer. It was perfect therefore, when that the Arke was at <hi>Silo,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> &amp; after in the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> when it was brought to <hi>Syon.</hi> But yet can it not bee ſaide, that the Church receyued no increaſe of comfort by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For when in ſteede of a Tabernacle, <hi>Salomon</hi> had buylded a Temple of ſtone, for the buylding and for all the furniture of it, for the matter and for the workmanſhip of as great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and ſtate as nature and any skill of man was able to worke it: although there was nothing added to the perfection of the paterne giuen to Moſes, yet was the ioy and comfort of the Church exceedingly increaſed. In the time of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, whyle the Church was yet in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> onely, the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed in it was perfect, and after when Churches began to be ſettled amongeſt the Iewes in the lande of <hi>Jurie,</hi> and in other partes before the conuerſion of the Gentiles, the regiment outward and ordinarie eſtabliſhed in them was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and receyued no increaſe of perfection in it ſelfe by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the worlde vnto the faith. But yet infinitely was the ioye and comfort of Gods people increaſed by it. For if <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells in heauen reioyce at the conuerſion of one ſinner, howe great doe we thinke the ioye of heauen and earth, of men and Angells must needes haue bin, for the conuerſion of the worlde.</hi> Neyther was it onely ſo great an increaſe of the comfort of the church, but withall of infinite benefite and helpe. For by this meanes, the Church and the regiment eſtabliſhed in it obteyned as manie protectours, friendes, and mainteyners of it, as there were ſoules amongeſt the Gentiles, that receyued the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith, who all brought with them to mainteyne &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the faith they had receyued to the bleſſed hope of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting lyfe, all the giftes which God had beſtowed vpon them. The ritche their ritches and treaſure, the ſtrong their ſtrength, the wyſe their counſell and aduyſe, the eloquent their perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19103:104"/> ſpeache, the learned their knowledge, &amp; the Magiſtrates their authoritie. Whereof the Prophetes foretolde, ſayinge: <hi>Reioyce,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 54.1.2</note> 
               <hi>ô barren, that diddest not beare, breake forth into ioy &amp; reioyce, thou that diddest not trauayle with childe: for the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late hath moe children then the married wyfe, ſaith the Lorde.</hi> Enlarge the place of thy Tentes, and let them ſpreade out the curtaynes of thine habitations: ſpare not, ſtretche out thy cordes, and make faſt thy ſtakes. For thou ſhalt increaſe on the right hande and on the left, and thy ſeede ſhall poſſeſſe the Gentiles, and dwell in the deſolate Cities. Whereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Gentiles maruelouſlie increaſed the ioye of the Church by their conuerſion to the faith of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and brought exceeding great helpe, benefite, ſtrength, protection, defence, and furtherance to the holy faith which they receyued, notwithſtanding that they made no newe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church, nor were not to make anie, but reſted as it was duetie in them in that perfect order which our Sauiour Chriſt before had eſtabliſhed amongeſt his people. Wherein they caried them ſelues according to that duetie whiche the Proſelytes yeelded, and were to yeelde to the auncient church and Synagogue of the Iewes. For if anie in that time adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them ſelues to the people of God to worſhip the trewe God, as he had declared it to his people, he would be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. They adioyned them ſelues as members to keepe, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, and obeye the orders they founde alreadie, ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt his people by the ordinance of Almightie God, and not as maiſters or Lordes ouer the holy Religion they embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to take away the leaſt curtayne-ring that was mentioned in the Lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor an inche of the height, length or breadth, the iuſt meaſure whereof was alreadie ſet downe, nor to adde anie newe office, ryte, order, or ceremonie, or to alter in anie ſorte whatſoeuer was accordinge to the Lawe of the Lorde. Whiche is to bee vnderſtoode, not onely of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of other countries that ſhould bee conuerted to the faith and religion of the Iewes, but of the moſt Noble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19103:104"/> them, ſuch as was <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> vpon whom the King his Maiſter leaned when he worſhipped his idoll:<note place="margin">2. Kin. 5.18.</note> or the Noble man that was Treaſurer of Queene <hi>Candaces,</hi> Queene of the <hi>Aethyopians.</hi> Nay, I adde further,<note place="margin">Actes 8.27.</note> that if <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi> had perſuaded his maiſter the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> or that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, the Queene of <hi>Aethyopia,</hi> to haue receyued the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Iewes, and to haue turned their whole people with them to the ſame, or if <hi>Cyrus</hi> that great Monarche, or the Queene of <hi>Saba,</hi> famous for hir wiſedome and ritches,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 10.1.</note> who both had dealinges with Gods people, had ſo receyued their fayth, and would haue eſtabliſhed it amongeſt all their people in all their Dominions, it had not bene lawfull for them to haue altered the leaſt iote or title of the Lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but euen they muſt haue yeelded them ſelues and all their people obedient to all thinges preſcribed in it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their ſoueraignitie whiche they had ouer their people, and which ſhould haue continued with them, and neyther haue diminiſhed nor increaſed for their conuerſion to the faith, but remayned altogither ſuch as it was lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, at anie time before ouer their people. Onely they were to mainteyne that holye profeſſion whiche they had ſo recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not as other priuate men, but as Soueraigne Magiſtrates, honouringe GOD in the maintenance of his trewe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with that power and authoritie whiche they had recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at his handes.</p>
            <p>For as no man that him ſelfe is ſufficient for wiſedome, and all other reſpectes, taketh a ſeruaunt into his houſe, or adopteth him a ſonne, or being a Prince, receyueth a forrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and incorporateth him into his people, by making him free, whatſoeuer qualitie or condition hee were of: yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee were a Soueraigne Prince and Gouernour, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anie order of his houſe, or anie lawe or ſtatute in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but to enioye the comfort and benefite of his houſe or kingdome, the orders and lawes thereof, ſuch as hee hath thought meete and conuenient for the gouernement thereof:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19103:105"/> So neyther <hi>Cyrus</hi> that <hi>Perſian</hi> Emperour, nor <hi>Candaces</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Queene, being receyued by ſuch profeſſion of true religion into the houſe and kingdome of God, who is onely wyſe, and all ſufficient to gouerne his owne, were to alter any order of Lawe of the ſame for all their Princelie Soueraigntie, but to keepe in their perſons, and to enforce their people by their ciuile power to obſerue all ſuch orders, lawes, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as God had commaunded to be obſerued in his houſe and kingdome. For howe great ſoeuer their power were, they had a Lord paramont ouer them, in reſpect of whom they were vaſſalls and ſeruauntes, who being compared with their people, were Lords and Princes ouer them. Whiche appeared in thoſe who were not ſinners, of the Gentiles, but Iewes by nature: of whom when any attempted the alteration of anie thing as diuerſe of the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> did, namely <hi>Achaz</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. King. 16.1 2. Sam. 6.7.</note> they were reprooued and grieuouſlie puniſhed for it. Notwithſtanding which matter that they who were naturall Princes of the Iewes, or if any of the Gentiles had bin conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their faith had no power to adde or take away, or in any ſorte to alter the leaſt thing whiche God had appointed: yet both exceeding great was the benefite of the King amongeſt the Iewes, And very profitable the conuerſion of the Princes of the Gentiles would haue bin vnto them. The ſame is to be ſayde of Chriſtian Princes: For our Sauiour Chriſt before the conuerſion of any of them hauing ſettled offices, orders and lawes for the guydance of his church in a perfect maner, their conuerſion getteth them no power to alter any jote of that he before had eſtabliſhed. Who, if they haue beleeued in him, is their Lorde, to whom they owe all homage, ſeruice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but are in as great duetie as any other to keepe and to maynteyne them, obſeruing the ſame in their owne perſons, which belongeth vnto them, and by their publique authoritie enforcing ciuillie all ſuch as are ſubiect vnto them, to like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Which ſeruice being done to the Sonne of GOD, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lordes, is no vnſeemely
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19103:105"/> thing for them, but both profitable &amp; honourable for them and for all their people. Yet is not therefore the conuerſion of Princes to the faith of Chriſt a matter of no benefite or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to the Church. Nay the commoditie is infinite to the Church of ſuch a Prince as I haue ſpoken of, as entreth into the Church not as a Lorde and maiſter ouer Gods houſe, to alter and chaunge at his pleaſure, but as a duetifull childe to keepe and ſee other, to keepe in Gods houſe, that which God hath commaunded to bee obſerued. For bringing togyther with him ſelfe the whole people that is ſubiect to him, not onely the comfort, but the helpe and benefite of the church is vnſpeakeably increaſed. Which is playne, in that there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the maintenance of the Church and the trewe ſeruice of God in it, the wealth, the ſtrength, the wyſedome, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and all the abilities of a whole people: Of whom, ſuch as are truelie conuerted vnto God, will holde nothing deare nor precious vnto them, no not their owne lyues, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the maintenance of Gods true Religion and worſhip, and the faithfull profeſſours of it, but will employe all the good meanes which God hath bleſſed them withall, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and mainteyne the ſame. In all whoſe giftes dedicated ſo to God, as the Church hath great helpe and comfort: ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie in thoſe which moſt yeeld that helpe and comfort ſuch as are the bleſſing of authoritie and power beſtowed of GOD vpon ſoueraigne Princes, which being ſanctifyed and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the ſeruice and honour of God that gaue it, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked both in the eccleſiiaſticall and ciuill ſtate are by ciuill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and puniſhment enforced to doe their dueties, and the godlie in both eſtates are protected in their innocencie and well-doeing from all ſuch as would oppreſſe them.</p>
            <p>The holy ſtorie declareth that religious and noble Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> haue made ſundrie ciuill ſtatutes to th'enforcing of all to worſhip God in general, and by their power haue puniſhed falſe prophetes and idolatours: haue commaunded the prieſts to doe ſuch dueties, as they ſtoode charged to performe, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19103:106"/> the true ſeruice of God, might be reſtored and eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne amongeſt his people.<note place="margin">Iere. 26.16.</note> We reade that when the Prieſtes would moſt wickedlie and vniuſtlie haue condemned <hi>Jeremie</hi> to death, diuers of the Kings counſell came vppon them, and by their authoritie deliuered him out of their handes.<note place="margin">Ierem. 38.11 12.13.</note> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing fauour with the king, deliuered him out of priſon. And an other time the King him ſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued the Prophete by remoouing him from <hi>Iehonathans</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.<note place="margin">Iere. 37.15.16.17.</note> Like examples reade we many, of the Emperours Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to the immortall prayſe of God for it, and the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all honour of ſuch Princes. We ſee diuers ſuch <hi>Joſias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantins</hi> in this age, of which ſpirit the Lorde poure out yet greater abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance from aboue, for the exceeding great helpe and comfort that we finde, and vppon ſuch a largeſſe hope yet to finde in greater aboundance by the ſanctifyed power of Chriſtian Princes. For they looking into former preſidentes of auncient times, and ſeeing cauſe of like duetie to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them ſelues, no doubt, will be carefull that all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall offices and orders not of God nor agreeable to his worde, be aboliſhed, and all ſuch eſtabliſhed as he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. Then not onely Princes ſhall receyue honour of their ſtyle of Supremacie, but the Church ſhall receyue alſo great comfort and benefite by it, in puniſhinge ſuch as ſhall without iuſt cauſe ſaye to the Prophete, Prophecie not, and to the Preachers, preache not: a matter not onely in higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree offenſiue to the Maieſtie of Almightie God, and againſt the ſaluation of mens ſoules, but alſo vnprofitable for their Crownes: ſeeing ignorance is the mother of all rebellion, &amp; the knowledge of God, of all trew loue and obedience. If any of them beate their fellow-ſeruauntes,<note place="margin">☞</note> or ſitte downe to drink with the drunken, and neglect the Lords houſholde, they will take knowledge of the abuſes and wronges offred to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes of God, and graciouſlie heare and redreſſe their iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. So great difference is there betweene <hi>Gallio</hi> ſuffringe a man to be beaten at his barre, and profanely neglecting it, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19103:106"/> caring for no ſuch things as were queſtions of Religion, &amp; a Chriſtian Prince fearing God in trueth and in deede. In que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions amongeſt the Miniſters according to the example of <hi>Constantine</hi> and others, they would cauſe the matters to bee hearde and debated in a ſoly and free Synode and aſſemblie, and without reſpect of perſons, authorize that which ſhould be moſt agreeable to Gods worde. In caſes of publique cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities threatning or lying vpon the Church, if the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call officers were negligent &amp; careleſſe in it, they would cauſe by due order a publike faſt to bee kept by all their ſubiectes, that the wrath of God might be turned away, and his fauour reconcyled agayne vnto his people. Finallie, their ciuill pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would enforce all men to honour God, and liue in duetie one to wardes another as they ought, defending the godlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mightie oppreſſour, the ſtaffe of the wrath of the good and the violent man, and puniſhe the iniquities of the wicked according to their deſertes in iuſtice and equitie. Theſe and many more which by theſe may be conſidered, are the helpes, commodities and benefites which the Church of God doeth, and may receyue by meanes of Chriſtian Princes. Notwithſtanding they make no other lawes, officers, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Churche then our Sauiour Chriſte hath alreadie made, and eſtabliſhed. Which may ſuffice for a number of the Repliers queſtions and other ſpeaches tendinge to this that there ſhould be little or no vſe of chriſtian Princes, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the church be perfect without them.</p>
            <p>In which diſcourſe allowing in ſome ſorte the regiment of the primitiue Church perfect, becauſe of the Apoſtles, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes, and Prophetes, whom then God gaue to the church, he ſayeth, thoſe offices were giuen as temporarie aydes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie th'aydes of Chriſtian Princes, which can not be ſo in anie ſorte. For there is no maner of proportion betweene their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the one being for preaching the worde and other ſuch like eccleſiaſticall functions, th'other for ciuill gouernement: the one by a ſpirituall power, the other by a temporall, beſides
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19103:107"/> a number of other differences whiche may eaſilie ſhewe the one could in no ſorte ſerue for ſupply of the other. Further, if it had bin ſo, then ſhould the Apoſtles and the reſt of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie officers, who he ſayth were giuen for ſupplie of the wante of the ordinarie authoritie of Princes, they ſhould then haue continued about 300. yeares longer then they did, euen to <hi>Constantines</hi> time. Nay then they ſhould haue bene alwayes ſuch to this day, and ſhalbe to the ende of the worlde in ſuch partes of the Church, where the former are enimies to Religion: otherwiſe wanting both them, and the ſupply, the Church might ſeeme weakelie prouided for. But as the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie of this poynt, nowe firſt deuyſed, the vanitie is ſo eaſilie manifeſt, as I ſhall not neede to tary longer vppon it. wherfore nowe I procede to that which foloweth in his reply.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the Replyer hath laboured in vayne, to ſhewe, that if it were graunted that in the primitiue Church there was yet no Prince become Chriſtian, notwithſtanding the regiment of the Church was not perfect before there was any chriſtian Prince. Nowe he pretendeth to proceede further to prooue that propoſition vntrew, which ſayeth there was not any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince then. For this vntowardly hath hee ſet it down: ſo as it can not be plainlie vnderſtood to what time his <hi>then,</hi> is to be referred, and chaungeth the wordes of the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are theſe: <hi>That all the regiment of the Church was perfect before there was any Christian Prince.</hi> Which propoſition hee ſhould haue vndertaken to haue ſpoken to, if he would haue ſayde any thing to the Declaration. But after hee hath ſette downe this propoſition to him ſelfe to prooue it vntrewe, that there was not any Chriſtian Prince then, hee leaueth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he vndertooke, and turneth aſyde to another thing, ſaying albeit ſo this be no good argument, nor this, nor this, and ſo maketh three ſundrie argumentes of his owne, as if they were vſed by the Declaration, but are not, and denyeth them to be good, which is nothing to the matter he tooke in hande. For if he make a hundreth yll argumentes, as he hath done in this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19103:107"/> booke, and can more eaſilie doe them, then make one good one, there is no reaſon to charge the Declaration for ſuch a cauſe as he mainteyneth. From this he goeth to ſhewe that it is not meete our brethren ſhould vſe the ſame argumentes that the Anabaptiſtes doe againſt Princes. Wherein he nameth vs, <hi>our brethren,</hi> as ſcorning vs. Whereof I knowe not what example he may haue, but of <hi>Iſmaell,</hi> who is ſaid to haue ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Iſaac:</hi> wherevpon th'Apoſtle ſayeth: <hi>As he that was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten according to the fleſhe, perſecuted him that was borne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſpirit, euen ſo is it nowe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reſt of that marginall note ſhewing whereabout hee goeth, is, that our brethren vſe the ſame argumentes, whiche the Anabaptiſtes doe againſt Princes. Which is ſo doubtfullie ſet downe, as if he could be content the Reader tooke it, not onely that the Anabaptiſtes vſe argumentes againſt Princes, but alſo that the Declaration vſeth the ſame argumentes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Princes. The Replier him ſelfe hath not ſo farre loſt all conſcience and modeſtie, as to charge vs in anie ſorte with any part of the damnable errours of the Anabaptiſtes, but plainlie acknowledgeth that we deteſt them, but ſomewhat he would fayne ſhould cleaue vnto vs. And therefore would haue it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, that we haue ſome indiſpoſition againſt Princes, &amp; that we haue thus much good liking of the diſputations of the Anabaptiſtes, as to vſe their argumentes againſt Princes. But the Lorde who ſeeth the ſecretes of all hartes, knoweth, that in our moſt inwarde ſpirit we reuerence and honour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie, as the holy and neceſſarie ordinance of God, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, and yeelde all willing and cheerfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto it, euen for conſcience ſake of the will of God. Therfore, the accuſer of our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelf, as he is termed in the reuelation, can not accuſe vs with any maner of colour of their errours. As for vſing their argumentes, where did euer the Anabaptiſtes vſe this argument, that in a treatiſe of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall regiment, good order requireth to ſpeake firſt of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall officers, before a man treate of the ſoueraigne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19103:108"/> of Princes, becauſe the Church was perfect in all hir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, before there was any Chriſtian Prince. Is this any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt Princes? or doeth it weaken any thing at all the power of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, that their authoritie be treated of in a booke, ſo as may ſtande beſt with good order? Where did euer any Anabaptiſtes vſe ſuch an argument? It were flatlie contrarie to their error, to vſe ſuch a one as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie implyeth allowance of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onely for a reaſon of the order of the treatiſe. But if the Declaration had vſed any argumentes of theirs, being not to the ſame ende, or like purpoſe that they vſed them, that is, to diſproue the neceſſarie &amp; moſt lawfull ordinance of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Magiſtrates, that had not bin blame worthie. For as hath bene ſaide, th'argumentes of Logike are as common to good and badde, as are the rules of grammer: yea as the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, and the rayne, ſo as if he would haue vs forbeare all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes that euer the Anabaptiſtes vſed, and by conſequence anie other heretiques, he may as well forbid vs to vſe the ſame rules of grammer, yea the ſame Sunne, ayre, water, and other things neceſſarie for this life. But howe ſtandeth this with his maintenance of the Popiſh Hierarchie and Iuriſdiction, &amp; ſo many popiſhe ſuperſtitions as he mainteyneth, all whiche it were more reaſon he ſhould refuſe, then to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with them and other, things of moſt neceſſarie vſe. But it is not for nothing that he obiecteth this, for by this meanes hee hath gotten the adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage of ſtuffing his booke with another mans labours. In deede if it be a faulte in a booke to be little, as hee ſcorned the booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer preſented of late in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for being litle, he hath founde a good remedie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde that fault, which is eaſilie auoyded, if one write ſo many not ſentences, but pages and leaues as he hath done out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens bookes. The Authour he alleadgeth is one <hi>Gellius,</hi> a godly learned man, as appeareth by his writings: but where he ſaith, it may ſeeme the declaration tooke many things out of him, he is greatly deceyued, for the declaration was written
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19103:108"/> not a fewe yeres before the booke of <hi>Gellius,</hi> which he ſaith ſo much is taken out. As for his writing againſt the Anabaptiſts, he hath dealt, as may well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend both his pietie &amp; learning, and be of verie good and profitable vſe vnto the Church, but to the matter of the declaration he ſayth nothing at all. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no cauſe to make any anſwere to him, who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing againſt vs. But if he alleadge him becauſe he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a text of ſcripture, then the Declaration doeth, it is not worth his labour of writing, this being no new thing that good writers may take ſome one text in other ſenſe then another doeth: prouided, that the ſenſe be alwayes ſuch, as may ſtande with the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith. So as the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no more in that caſe to be preſſed with the opinion or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of <hi>Gellius,</hi> then <hi>Gellius</hi> or any other, is to bee with his that wrote the Declaration. Which yet if he will preſſe further, the trueth is that the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the expoſition of the 12. to the Romanes, &amp; the 12. of the former epiſt. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> hath both the trueth it ſelfe to beare witnes to it, and the beſt writers of this age. For it is cleare, that the worde Gouernor in thoſe places noteth only eccleſiaſticall officers, all ſure and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances of that place ſo inforcing it. Another point he would take of <hi>Gellius,</hi> is, that he ſaith, that Magiſtracy and miniſterie haue bin moſt nearely ioyned togither, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as appeareth by <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron.</hi> Which is godly &amp; truly ſaid of <hi>Gellius:</hi> but what is this, either for the replier, or againſt the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The reaſon gathered hereof is ſuch, as I thinke no man of reaſon would haue looked for, that is, as he noteth in the margent, that the ciuill Magiſtrate hath euer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning bin ioyned with the eccleſiaſticall miniſtery, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby that then it muſt needes haue bin ſo likewiſe in the primitiue Church. But <hi>Gellius</hi> his meaninge is ſo farre from this, as it may ſeeme hee hath bene couſined in it, and giuen to light credite to other that haue abuſed him, or els to haue vſed ſmall eyther diligence or conſcience in this collection.</p>
            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:19103:109"/>
            <p>For the purpoſe of <hi>Gellius</hi> is farre other in that place, namely, to ſhewe that Magiſtracie and eccleſiaſticall miniſterie, are not as the Anabaptiſtes would haue it, thinges that can not ſtande togither. For (ſayeth he) theſe fight not betweene them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, but from the beginning were moſt nearily ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although the propertie of eyther be diſtinguiſhed in the Church, as is playne in the examples of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Wherein <hi>Gellius</hi> godly and truelie proueth, that theſe two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God are not enimies, ſo that the one ſhould not abyde the other, but rather that from the beginning they were of good and friendlie agreement, whiche is well prooued by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who being brethren, and eyther of them bearing the chiefe office in either ſtate both ciuill and eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, ſheweth a naturall and brotherlie reſpect betweene theſe two ſtates, and that naturallie from the beginning they haue mainteined comforted &amp; cheriſhed one another. This is it onely which <hi>Gellius</hi> meaneth there, whiche is as farre from the Repliers collection, as thoſe two ſtates are ſayde by <hi>Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and are in deede, neare one to another, as may appeare moſt euidentlie by ſundrie other circumſtances of that place, and the direct oppoſition of theſe wordes, <hi>they fight not betweene them ſelues,</hi> to theſe, <hi>but haue bin alwayes most nearely ioyned togither,</hi> and the adiectiue <hi>there</hi> vſed in the ſuperlatiue degree of compariſon, in which ſorte no man ſpeaking Latin would ſaye, that theſe two had bin alwayes togither, but in the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. To like purpoſe he noteth out of another place, a little after in the margent, the ciuill and eccleſiaſticall power ioyned alwayes in the Church, and in the texte of the wordes of his tranſlation, ſetteth downe in a diuerſe letter theſe words, <hi>haue alwayes bin ioyned togither.</hi> Wherevpon he gathereth thus: If it were alwayes ioyned togither, that is to ſay, the Magiſtracie &amp; eccleſiaſticall miniſterie, it was euen then ioyned when our brethren auouch that it was not onely diſioyned, but that the one was perfect, when the other was not at all. Wherein hee committeth the ſame groſſe ouerſight that hee did in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19103:109"/> place. For <hi>Gellius</hi> in this place gathereth his generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of ſundrie argumentes alleadged before. Whereof this, hauing bin of the good agreement that hath alwayes bin in the Church from the beginning betweene theſe two fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, togither with the reſt, he reckoneth vp this almoſt in the ſame wordes, he had ſet it downe in before. Whiche ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it can haue no other ſenſe in the concluſion, then it had before, it is playne, no ſuch thing can bee gathered of it as the Replyer pretendeth. As impertinent are his other collections and obſeruations out of the ſame authour, as that thoſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſo much commended before by the Declaration, are troubled with Anabaptiſtes. His purpoſe was to prooue, that there were Chrſtian Princes in the primitiue Church, but how farre wyde roueth he from this marke, in telling vs of another matter, of Anabaptiſtes. Of whom yet that hee ſayeth is not trewe, that the Churches commended before by the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are the ſame that are ſayd by <hi>Gellius</hi> there, by accident to be troubled with that ſecte. But if it were, ſhould that diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende their reformation according to Gods worde? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it commendeth them, that they are ſo amongeſt them, as that they are not hidden nor alowed nor ſuffered ſo to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, but diſcouered and diſprooued in worde and in writing, and in publike diſputation for their recouerie, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or els for the keeping of thoſe who are yet ſincere not to be ſeduced by them. Yet if this muſt needes be an embaſing of the honour of the reformation of thoſe Churches, I would he could ſay for ours that there are none of the familie, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants, yea no Anabaptiſtes nor Libertines, nor of anie other erronious ſecte amongſt vs or could ſhewe in any part of the worlde anie fielde of the Lordes, where the Enimie ſoweth not tares amongſt the wheate, or anie flooore where the wheate is not mingled with chaffe, and that not onely in regarde of euil life, but alſo of erroneous doctrines, according as it was ſayde to the church of <hi>Corinth, there must be hereſies amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst you, that they who are tryed and ſounde in fayth, may bee made manifest.</hi>

            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:19103:110"/>
            <p>His next obſeruation out of <hi>Gellius</hi> is, that the ſtate of the olde Teſtament and new is all one, which, as <hi>Gellius</hi> there tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that is, concerning the way of iuſtification and the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the morall lawe is very trewe, but nothinge to the Replyers purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The next obſeruation, which is, that God did by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie power puniſhe the wicked, where the ordinarie was wanting, that is, as he expoundeth by the Apoſtles <hi>Peeter</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> puniſhe <hi>Ananias, Saphyra,</hi> and <hi>Elymas,</hi> when the chief and ordinarie Magiſtrates ouer them were not Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: is not onely nothing for his purpoſe as the former, but directlie againſt him. For him ſelfe confeſſeth contrarie to that he pretended to proue in the beginning and by a former obſeruation out of <hi>Gellius,</hi> that alwayes the two functions of Magiſtracy and miniſterie haue bin ioyned in the church, and his collection vpon that. Therefore euen in that time, when it is denyed by the Declaration to haue bin ſo. He nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that the chiefe and ordinarie Magiſtrates were not then Chriſtian Princes. If he had not confeſſed it, the trueth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is manifeſt by the Actes of the Apoſtles in <hi>Paules</hi> appealing to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and all the ſtories of that age. But his owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Actes 25.11.</note> was not to be pretermitted. Yet as if hee knewe not his owne voyce, or would denie his owne hande, he continueth his purpoſe to prooue out of <hi>Gellius,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vntrueth, that Princes ſhould haue bin Chriſtians in that time.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe, although it be in deede nothing to the purpoſe, he noteth out of him, that contrarie to the aſſertion of the Declaration, <hi>Gellius</hi> ſheweth, that there were Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in the time of Chriſt and the Apoſtles. As if the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration denyed that the worlde was then gouuerned by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as it hath alwayes bin, or that any bearinge any ciuill office receyued the fayth of Chriſt, and yet continued their calling. Neyther of theſe is denyed by the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ende <hi>Gellius</hi> fitlie alleadgeth the examples of <hi>Cornelius</hi> &amp;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19103:110"/> other: but, the Declaration ſpeaketh expreſlie of ſoueraigne Princes, ſaying, But of the ſupreame authoritie of Chriſtian Princes, and after in the wordes which the Replier hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to diſproue, that the Church of God was perfect in all hir regiment, before there was anie Chriſtian Prince. Yet of this moſt impertinent reply, and of this his ſo fruitleſſe labour this is to be noted, that he confeſſeth the queſtion to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the tyme of Chriſt and the Apoſtles time. In whoſe time if he pretende any ſoueraigne Prince to haue bin Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, he were worthie a better rewarde then he can by any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon looke for. But where as he reprochfully and deſpitefullie ſetteth it downe that <hi>Gellius</hi> proceeding commeth to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baptiſtes obiection of this ſelfe ſame reaſon that our brethren in this learned diſcourſe doe vrge, that is, that the Church of God was perfect in all hir regiment before there was any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince. Beholde what wordes of <hi>Gellius</hi> hee citeth to proue it. But they obiect (ſayeth Gellius) that in the time of Chriſt and of Paule, there was no Chriſtian Magiſtrate. If this be their obiection, howe is it the ſelfe ſame reaſon that is vſed by the Declaration, which ſpeaketh not of all Magiſtrates, but onely of ſoueraigne Princes. Further <hi>Gellius</hi> beginneth his aunſwere therevnto thus, as he him ſelfe hath tranſlated him: The authoritie of the Magiſtrate is not therefore weakened, albeit in the time of Chriſt and of Paule, Emperours &amp; Kings ſet in high eſtate were aliens from the faith. Could any thing be ſpoken more directly againſt that which he would prooue by this teſtimonie, or more expreſſelie, for that which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſayeth, and he would improue. Yet from this page he beginneth to ſet theſe wordes in the toppe of the page, in a diuers letter, <hi>Christian Princes from the beginning,</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in the next, <hi>Christian Princes in the Apostles times,</hi> &amp; from theſe being the 136. and 137. pages, to the 145. in whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che and the next he hath, <hi>Christian Princes from the beginning.</hi> All which conteyne litle els, but <hi>Gellius</hi> wordes, worde for worde tranſlated. A preatie way to make a ſhewe to the ſtate
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19103:111"/> of hauing taken great paynes to mainteyne the eccleſiaſticall gouernement of it. If he can helpe him ſelfe thus, with ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing his booke with other mens writings. We haue heard how <hi>Gellius</hi> entreth into that diſcourſe, playnlie diſauowinge the proofe of that, in the very beginning, for whiche hee would haue him ſpeake. Vpon which place, it ſerued wel for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to make that note in the margent: but ſurely modeſtie and ſhamefaſtnes neuer aduyſed him, to ſet ſo direct an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth ſo hye in his booke, that all men might ſee it. For in all the reſt of <hi>Gellius</hi> wordes, in ſo many leaues as I haue noted, rehearſed by him, there is no ſuch matter intended nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Onely in naming ſuch Magiſtrates as were called to the faith of Chriſt, he reckoneth vp the<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 8.5.</note>

Wherein let euery thing be enforced to the vtmoſt, yet will he come ſhort by many degrees, of a ſoueraigne Prince of the faith of our Sauiour Chriſt in that tyme. Which principall purpoſe notwithſtanding he miſſe of, yet ſuppoſed he not to leeſe his labour in writing out ſo many leaues of an other mans booke, to ſtuffe his owne withall, &amp; therefore hath ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered obſeruations as he goeth, in the margent, which, belike, he thought the Reader ſhould take as admonitions, that ſuch a matter ſerued for him, and made againſt the Declaration. Whereof one in his margent is, <hi>A Church without a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, neuer ſeene:</hi> whereby hee would ſeeme to giue his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to vnderſtande, that <hi>Gellius</hi> ſhould denie that euer there had bene ſeene any Church, where the people haue not bene gouerned by chriſtian Magiſtrates, which is nothing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Gellius.</hi> For hee ſpeaketh of Magiſtrates in generall, and the vſe of it in the ordinance of GOD, to puniſhe the wicked, and to protect him, that liueth according to his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what ſoeuer the Magiſtrate bee in regarde of his religion.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19103:111"/> And in this ſenſe denyeth, that euer there hath bene ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Church where the people of it haue not bene ſubiect to Magiſtrates, which is very trew. For euen in the time of our Sauiour Chriſt and the Apoſtles, the Empire of <hi>Roome</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and ruled in a manner all the worlde, as it is noted in the thirde Chapter of Saint Lukes Goſpell. And as there were Magiſtrates that ruled then ouer men in all places, ſo the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God in Magiſtracie,, What ſoeuer the religion of the Magiſtrates were, was needfull and profitable vnto the Church. Whereof the reaſon is euident, for that thereby, they were oftentimes in their innocencie deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe who would haue done them wrong, as <hi>Paule</hi> was by appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Therefore, whereas hee noteth in the next place, that the godlie haue neede of the Magiſtrate, is likewiſe trewe: yea and the next to it, whiche hee noteth out of <hi>Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that the vſe of Magiſtracie is ſuch, as that it were rather to bee wiſhed there were no common wealth without a trewe Chriſtian Magiſtrate, then the Chriſtian Magiſtrate ſhould be excluded from the Church of God, that is that a chriſtian bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ciuill office, ſhould therfore be cut of from the church as the Anabaptiſtes would. For this is plainly the meaning of <hi>Gellius,</hi> howſoeuer he haue ſet downe the note of his wordes ſhortly and obſcurely, &amp; fitlie to make the reader gather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſenſe, as if <hi>Gellius</hi> meant to ſay, rather, no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth without a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, then a Magiſtrate excluded from the Church, or not to bee reckoned an eccleſiaſticall office. But the ſenſe (as I ſayde) is playne. In whiche mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo is that written whereof hee maketh after this note in the margent, <hi>The Magistrates office neceſſarie to the church,</hi> not that the Churche cannot ſtande, except the Magiſtrate, where the Church is, bee of the faith, but that what ſoeuer hee bee in that reſpecte, his office in the ordinance of GOD, is neceſſarie, and comfortable to the Churche.</p>
            <p>To which ende <hi>Gellius</hi> addeth for proofe in the verie next wordes, otherwiſe why did Paule and Peter write of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19103:112"/> to the faithful that were ſubiect to the diſcipline of Chriſt. For the Romanes to whom hee wrote, were vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> as were alſo at that time the other. His next note in the margent vpon <hi>Gellius</hi> his wordes is, that certayne of the Prophetes and Apoſtles exerciſed alſo the office of the Magiſtrate. This is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of his impertinencies, I might ſaye vntruethes, for heere <hi>Gellius</hi> attributeth this no more to the Apoſtles, then to our Sauiour Chriſt, who directlie ſaid, <hi>His kingdome was not of this worlde:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 18.36.</note> but I chieflie note his impertinencie. For what is this to proue, that he vndertooke (to witte) that there were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes in the Apoſtles times. But he had a meaning to admoniſhe the Reader to ſtaye &amp; conſider of the poyntes here handled by <hi>Gellius,</hi> wherevnto alſo tendeth his next note, why God diſtinguiſhed thoſe offices. For there <hi>Gellius</hi> ſhewinge, that theſe functions are not contrarie, ſo as for the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their nature, they could not meete togither, but that the one ſhould deſtroy th'other, as fire and water, ſeeing <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech, Eli,</hi> &amp; <hi>Samuell</hi> exerciſed both: and the diſtinguiſhing of them, was not for their repugnancie, but becauſe one man was ſcarſe ſufficient to exerciſe both. He might thinke perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, the Reader might gather here, ſomething by the way for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of both offices in thoſe that are of the miniſterie. But of this there wilbe a fitter place to ſpeake. Here it may ſuffice to admoniſhe the Reader of the inſufficiencie whiche <hi>Gellius</hi> noteth to be in men for exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of both offices. For which cauſe God did diſtinguiſh and ſeuer them to be adminiſtred by diuers perſons.</p>
            <p>Thus proceedeth he on ſtill with <hi>Gellius,</hi> noting in the next place the example of Chriſtian Magiſtrates in Chriſt and the Apoſtles times. Whiche is that place where Gellius maketh mention of the Captaynes or Centurions, of <hi>Joſeph, Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and ſuch like, wherevnto I haue anſwered before alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Replyer hauing fought a great whyle with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans weapons, and perſuading him ſelfe that his owne
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:19103:112"/> right hande had done valiauntlie, beginneth to ſounde his trumpet as if the victorie were his owne, ſaying, thus wee ſee moſt euidently, howe weake this reaſon is, to witte, of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Churches regiment before there were any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, and with what a multitude of farre better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yea with a cloude of witneſſes, it is beaten downe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he reioyceth as if a blinde man ſtriking often at a venture, becauſe he hath wearied him ſelfe, ſhould triumphe, as if hee had driuen his enimie out of the fielde. Yet hauinge in the middeſt of this his blinde vanitie ſome glymſe that this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon commeth ſtill like an armed man vpon him, hee holdeth out this bucklar againſt it, that it auayleth not to ſaye, they were no Emperours. For (ſayeth he) it euicteth the cauſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie, that they were Princes, or at leaſt any kinde of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>
            <p>In deede, if it may ſuffice, to ſhewe that any Magiſtrates in the time of our Sauiour Chriſt receyued the faith of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, he hath wonne his ſpurres, and is worthie if not to bee knighted, yet Biſhopped, which I thinke he had rather be. But the queſtion is onely of ſoueraigne Princes, whether any ſuch were Chriſtians in that time. Whiche his cloude of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes vaniſhing away like a cloude, or as a cloude without wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, driuen about with euery winde, hath not bin able to doe for him. Yet is he not ſatisfied thus to leaue the matter, but obiecteth againſt him ſelfe, that thoſe Magiſtrates exerciſed no authoritie ouer the Church, but were in it as priuate men. Which is very true, but not alleadged by the Declaration, and therefore no cauſe he ſhould enter into the diſprooue of that, except he can not endure that any trueth ſtande before him. To this hauing litle to ſaye of him ſelfe, he ſayeth that <hi>Gellius</hi> ſayeth ſomewhat to this, out of whom yet he noteth no one word to this purpoſe, but to another, he noteth, that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches regiment, is more happie, where Chriſtian Princes are. Which thing the Declaration might haue taught him. And thus farre hath he reaſoned out of <hi>Gellius,</hi> againſt the firſt part
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19103:113"/> of the argument of the Declaration, affirming the Churches regiment to haue bene perfect before that anie Princes were Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>For that which he addeth after of his owne, of <hi>Paules</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to <hi>Caeſar</hi> for the deciſion, as hee ſayeth of an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call controuerſie, is of ſo ſmall colour of likelihoode, as can not eaſilie abuſe anie. For, who will be ſo abſurde, as to thinke that Paule referred the deciſion of the queſtion hee had with the Iewes, concerning ſaluation by our Sauiour Chriſte, as it is Eccleſiaſticall, to <hi>Nero,</hi> who vnderſtoode nothinge of thoſe matters, and was him ſelfe a great enemie, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeemeth to call him, as a Lyon, readie to deuoure all that made profeſſion of that faith.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.17</note> It were time nowe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to his replye to the other parte of the argument, but that the Reader is firſte to be admoniſhed concerning <hi>Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> out of whom the Replyer hath written ſo many leaues, (becauſe of all other he thought him to write moſt ſoundlie and fauourablie of the office and power of Magiſtrates,) that this ſame <hi>Gellius,</hi> ſo duetifull to Magiſtrates, is an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour of that eccleſiaſticall gouuernement, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer in all his booke oppugneth. Whereof it is to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the reformed Diſcipline, which is deſired to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongeſt vs, is in no ſorte preiudiciall to Chriſtian Princes, or other Magiſtrates. For <hi>Gellius,</hi> who writeth as earneſtlie for the maintenance of the reformed Diſcipline as anie, the ſame alſo writeth as duetifullie of the office and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Magiſtrates, and as largelie: yea and more againſt the Anabaptiſtes, then euer did any of the Romane Hierarchie, or vnreformed Diſcipline. Therefore, notwithſtandinge our ſeekinge to aduaunce by all good and lawfull meanes, that holy ordinance of GOD, of the onely lawfull Diſcipline, whereby the Church ought to bee guyded: wee may be, and are by the grace of God, as loyall and louing ſubiectes, as duetifull and obedient, as anie are of their whyte coate, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they ſtriue ſo much for. Beſides this, the Reader is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19103:113"/> the good diſcretion of the Replyer, in reſting ſo wholy vppon the authoritie of Gellius in this matter. Whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie if he acknowledge ſo graue and of ſuch credite, as if it had bin againſt vs, he would haue giuen ſentence againſt vs vppon it, why ſhould not the ſame mans witnes, bee of like waight and credite to iuſtifie our cauſe, and to preiudice his, if ſo be his teſtimonie may be ſhewed to be with vs and againſt him in this cauſe of the Diſcipline of the Church. But this is manifeſt, by a treatiſe of <hi>Gellius,</hi> expreſſelie written of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Diſcipline. Out of which I might write more leaues to ſhewe his iudgement, and his reaſons in the diuerſe pointes of Diſcipline, for that onely lawfull and holy order which the Replyer hath audaciouſlie ſet him ſelfe againſt, and oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, then he wrote out of him, to no purpoſe, for the office of the Magiſtrate. Whereby it is cleare, that if he ſtande to the witneſſe of <hi>Gellius,</hi> he hath loſt the whole cauſe hee laboureth ſo greatlie to mainteyne. Nowe I proceede to the reſt of his replye.</p>
            <p>The Declaration for proofe of the order to be followed in that treatiſe, hauing alleadged, that the regiment of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was perfect before there were any chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princes, addeth further, that it may &amp; doeth ſtande at this day in moſt bleſſed eſtate where the ciuill Magiſtrates are not the greateſt fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. The reply to this, beginneth with ſuch an exclamation, as a man would thinke he hearde &amp; ſawe the hye Prieſt, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Goſpell, renting his cloathes, and cryinge, <hi>Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede we any more witneſſes?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.65.</note> Behold now you haue heard his blaſphemie, what thinke you? yet was it no euill that was ſpoken, but a moſt holy trueth, whiche that prieſt of all other ought to haue perceyued. There follow next idle repetitions, as of other thinges, ſo of his former vayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes, what vſe then there may bee of Chriſtian Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, to the Church? Wherevppon I haue alreadie aunſwered, ſhewinge the Magiſtrates to bee ordeyned of GOD, for the protection of the good, and puniſhment of the euil doer. And
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:19103:114"/> that as in other matters, ſo alſo in things that concerne reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that we may liue vnder them, a peaceable and quiet life, in all pietie and honeſtie. For of ſuch things haue they charge alſo, eſpeciallie Magiſtrates which are of good Religion. For which cauſe the Kings were commaunded in the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to haue by them a copye of the lawe, and charged to ſee the ſame obſerued,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.18.</note> not in one part onely, which concerneth the dueties of the ſeconde table, but alſo of the firſt. All which things whyle Magiſtrates procure and further by their ciuill power and authoritie, bleſſed are they in ſo holy and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeruice, and bleſſed is the Church that receyueth ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great helpe, benefite, and comfort by them.</p>
            <p>A litle quarell here is in the next place, againſt the wordes, <hi>most bleſſed.</hi> Wherevnto it is replyed, that the Church can not be ſayde to be moſt bleſſed till it be in heauen. But he is to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, that it is not ſpoken of the Church ſimply, but in ſome reſpect. Which alſo he graunteth, a little after, ſayinge him ſelfe of the primitiue church, that it ſeemed <hi>in most bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed estate in ſome reſpectes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore the Church may be ſayde to be in moſt bleſſed eſtate, when it is ordered in all thinges according to Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, whiche is the greateſt bleſſing it may haue in this lyfe, ſo the Declaration ſpeaketh of the Churches which are bleſſed in that reſpect. The ſtate of the auncient Church of the Iewes, was then in moſt bleſſed eſtate in ſuch reſpecte, when all things in it aunſwered the paterne ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mountayne, and the primitiue Church, when it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the rules of our Sauiour Chriſt. So are the Churches of this age, ſayde for the ſame reſpect to be in moſt bleſſed eſtate.</p>
            <p>From this he returneth againe to his queſtion ſo often moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before, what vſe then there may be, of the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. For which he is to be returned agayne in like maner to his former aunſwere. Which is, that th'vſe of them is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great in euery ſorte, and would be yet a great deale
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19103:114"/> more if their godly proceedings were not hindered by miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of ſuch, who, for their place and the truſt repoſed in them, ought both to knowe and declare the will of God, to Chriſtian Princes, to the furthering of the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch abuſes, the continuance whereof prouoketh the wrath of God againſt both the Prince &amp; the people: Who mainteyning that all is well, (when in the gouernance of the Church, ſo manie things are amiſſe, and neede moſt ſpeedy reformation) abuſe them ſelues and the Princes whom they ought faithefullie to ſerue, (as <hi>Azariah</hi> and <hi>Hananias</hi> the Prophetes did <hi>Aſa</hi> King of <hi>Juda:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Chro. 15. 1 Cap. 16 7. Ierem. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ieremie Joſiah,</hi> with ſundrie other) and ſo haſten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them &amp; their people the fierie flying vengeance, that for ſuch enormities may come, ſo mightily and ſuddainly, that there wilbe no turning of it backe, nor eſcaping from it. Wherein, God be mercifull and ſpare his ſanctuarie, that it be not made deſolate, for the Lordes ſake, but to returne to the ſeruice,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.17.</note> whereby for my parte, I may endeuour to procure ſo great a bleſſing, in maintenance of the trueth of God, in the cauſe of the further reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needful in the diſcipline, as it hath bin thorowe the goodnes of God made in the doctrine. I proceed to anſwere his next poynt of reply to this argument. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie is an iniurious and a bitter diſcourſe, of the difference of the ſtate of the Church in perſecution and in peace, which he affirmeth to be hir moſt bleſſed eſtate. It is ſet out by oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Princes perſecuting, and protecting the Church, as of <hi>Pharao</hi> and <hi>Moſes, Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid, Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> the <hi>Turke, Sophi</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> and the Chriſtian Princes in <hi>Englande, Germanie, Scotlande, Denmarke, &amp;c.</hi> The end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is to charge the Declaration, with a groſſe and foule abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie as if it affirmed the Church in times paſt to haue bene in better ſtate vnder Tyrants and perſecutours then vnder godly and vertuous Princes, and in this age vnder the heathen, then vnder Chriſtian Princes. Wherevppon he cryeth out, <hi>O blinde</hi> (what ſhould I call it) <hi>malice, no, but ſelfe-willed opinion,</hi> that to deface the good eſtate of the church of God, wherein we are (vnder ſuch a right defendor of the faith) defended and ſhiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19103:115"/> from all our enimies, in a farre more bleſſed eſtate then we deſerue, will make ſuch an odious compariſon as this is. But as the olde ſaying is: <hi>Itch and eaſe can no man pleaſe.</hi> If a beame of a Biſhoprike had not hindred his ſight, hee might haue ſeene more clearely, both in many other places, and in this, that there is no ſuch compariſon made as he cauilleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. It is ſaide in the Declaration, that the Church at this day ſtandeth in moſt bleſſed eſtate where the ciuill Magiſtrates are not the greateſt fauourers. Whereat although he ieſtingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde after his maner, whether this be in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> or where yet either he muſt be ſtarke blinde, or els hee muſt needes ſee that it is meant of the Countries neare vnto vs, wherein the Churches are in ſome reſpect in moſt bleſſed eſtate. Whiche bleſſednes if he ſcorne at for the perſecution whiche they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, what will he anſwere to our Sauiour Chriſt, ſaying: <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhall ye be when men reuyle you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ma. 5.11.12</note> 
               <hi>&amp; perſecute you, and ſay all maner of euill against you for my ſake falſlie. Reioyce</hi> &amp; <hi>be glad, for great is your reward in heauen. For ſo perſecuted they the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phetes which were before you.</hi> Further alſo, in regard of the full reformation of the church, both in the doctrine and diſcipline of our Sauiour Chriſt, which the Lorde that is riche in mercie hath for their more aboundant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, giuen them to enioy in this their outward troubleſome &amp; perſecuted eſtate. For theſe and ſuch like reſpectes, declared vpon occaſion before in this treatiſe, the Declaration calleth their eſtate moſt bleſſed. In reproch whereof he exhorteth the Miniſters, zealous of the further reformation of our church to be gone into thoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, if they iudge the eſtate of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be better then our owne. I maruell not if the ſucceſſours of <hi>Amazia</hi> would fayne haue the ſucceſſours of <hi>Amos</hi> to depart both out of the Court,<note place="margin">Amos 7.12.</note> and countrey too. For then might they more freely abuſe whome they would. But the duetie of our calling, wherevnto almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God of his great mercie hath called vs, whiche is to ſerue eſpeciallie the church of our own nation &amp; people, amongeſt whom we are borne and brought vp, whoſe language is ours
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19103:115"/> by nature, &amp; with whom we are to haue all thinges common both bleſſings and puniſhmentes, as the ſeruaunts of God in <hi>Iewrie</hi> had, will not ſuffer vs to hearken to his rude motion, leaſt we ſhould with <hi>Jonas</hi> fly from the preſence of the Lorde. Further, as the terrour of God, ſo the loue of our people &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our kinred and acquaintance, not onely in the fleſhe, but alſo in the Lorde, is more deare and precious to vs, then that we may depart from them, for whoſe ſake, wee ought to bee readie, to want, euen that ſo great a bleſſing, as from our harte we acknowledge it to be, as to liue in a church reformed both in doctrine and diſcipline, and wholy in euerie reſpecte, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gouernement of our Sauiour Chriſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> were caryed ſo farre beyond this in a like zeale and loue of their people,<note place="margin">Exe. 32.32. Rom. 9.3.</note> as (whatſoeuer the Replyer thinke) they that ſuppoſe any parte of their ſpirit to bee in vs, neede not maruell, although for ſome like cauſe, we ſhould depriue our ſelues of ſuch a bleſſing, as we want, in not being in thoſe churches. Further alſo as the worthie ſeruauntes of God, the Miniſters of the Goſpell there, left not their countryes becauſe they wanted this full reformation in the beginning, but knew it to be the calling of God that they ſhould labour by all good dueties to procure it: So likewiſe doe we vnderſtande, that we are charged with like duetie to our church, to further as much as by any godly meanes, agreable to our callings, we may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie doe, the further reformation of our Church, that wee may ſee and enioye the fulnes of the glorie and mercie of god vpon it. Wherein howſoeuer the hinderer of reformation that ſtoode at the right hande of <hi>Jehoſuah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach. 3.1.</note> haue hindred vs hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: yet doe we hope in God, that hee will ſhewe vs mercie in time, to take away all things whiche hinder the glorie of God in his Church: as thoſe garmentes whereof <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſpeaketh did in <hi>Jehoſuah,</hi> and the reſtoring of the auncient honour of that Church, was figured in the putting on of his holy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which were according to the lawe of God put vppon him: ſo likewiſe doe we hope, &amp; pray, that the Lord will cauſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19103:116"/> the honour that ſometimes ſhined in it to be ſeene agayne, &amp; that holy,<note place="margin">Zach. 3.2.</note> ſeemely, &amp; only lawful gouernement of the church which he hath commaunded to be reſtored. For reſtoringe of which comfort and glorie, as the Lorde hath begon to rebuke Sathan the Prince of the Angells of darknes, and miniſters of iniquitie, and hinderers of the full reformation of the church: and hath taken our Church as a brande out of the fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſumed, ſo hath he giuen thereby iuſt cauſe of hope, that he will in his good time doe it all honour. In which hope we ſtande before the Lord, and wayte ſtill vpon him, till hee may giue order and commaundement for the taking away of all vnholy and profane ceremonies, ſuperſtitions, and vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations from his Church, &amp; eſpeciallie ignoraunce, negligence, couetouſnes, and ambition from the Miniſters of it, which as vnſeemely and defyled garmentes diſhonour the glorie of the ſame, and for the furniſhing of the Church with lawfull and holy orders, offices, and authoritie, and the miniſterie of it chieflie with godly wiſedome and faithfulnes, which may bee vnto both, as the ornament of <hi>Aarons</hi> head, promiſed to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhuah.</hi> This is the aunſwere that I haue to make to this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber exhortation of the Replyer,<note place="margin">Zach. 3.5.</note> and to all ſuch as being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no better aduyſed then he is, ſhall at any time vſe the like. The next quarell is about the ſenſe of ciuill Magiſtrates, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom the Declaration ſayeth, the Church is ſo bleſſed, notwithſtanding they bee not the greateſt fauourers of the Church.</p>
            <p>Wherein firſte inquyring whether this bee meant of hir right Excellent Maieſtie, (a queſtion voyde of all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iudgement and vnderſtanding, the wordes being moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to the contrarie) he gathereth after, ſundrie thinges, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vncharitably he would impute to the Declaration. But the Declaration in all places ſpeaketh reuerentlie and dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie, as it becommeth one, that is well inſtructed of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is due to that highe and ſoueraigne authoritie, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che God hath honoured hir Maieſtie withall, to the great
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:19103:116"/> comfort of all hir faythfull and loyall ſubiectes: although in deede it vſe not that gloſing ſtyle nor palpable flatterie, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mention of hir higheſt eſtate, nor of the eſtates neare vnto it, which is vſed by ambitious ſuters for benefices and Biſhoprikes. The ſpeache of the Declaration being ſuch as I haue ſaide, and hauing no eye to the ſoueraingtie, which God hath ſet ouer vs, yet, as one that will not leaue to vſe wringing and violence till he drawe bloud, ſo ceaſeth he not, but ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and wringeth till he may drawe out ſome bloudy accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſlaunderous and vnduetiful ſpeache of her Maieſtie.<note place="margin">Prou. 30.33.</note> Which becauſe it needeth no aunſwere on our parte, and the very repetition of his vnſeemely ſpeaches and ſtryuing about them, can not but be offenſiue to the duetifull ſubiect: I ſtand not vppon it. But whereas he would proue both by other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and by the Prophete <hi>Eſay,</hi> that God doeth a great fauour to his Church, when he raiſeth vp Princes to fauour and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, he is to vnderſtande, wee no les acknowledge the goodnes of God herein, then any other. The words of the Prophet which he alleadgeth, are theſe:<note place="margin">Eſa. 49.23.</note> 
               <hi>Kings ſhalbe thy nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Fathers, and Queenes ſhalbe thy Nources: they ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thee with their faces towardes the earth, and like the dust of thy feete: and thou ſhalt knowe that I am the Lord for they ſhall not be aſhamed that wayte for me.</hi> Wherein the Prophete no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by the ſimilitudes of Foſter fathers and Nourſes, the loue, care, faithfulnes, watchfulnes, and diligence that Princes ſhall haue to preſerue, mainteyne, nouriſhe, and comfort the Church: and in the bowing the heade to the grounde, the honour they ſhall doe to our Sauiour Chriſte, the heade of the Church, and conſequentlie to the Church it ſelfe, in him. For in bowing them ſelues to lowe, as doeing homage to the Sonne of GOD, they promiſe all faythfull duetie, ſeruice and obedience vnto him.</p>
            <p>The performance whereof is to renounce in them ſelues, and to aboli he from amongeſt their people, all falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and idolatrie, with like zeale as <hi>Ezekiah and Ioſiah</hi> did,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19103:117"/> and to eſtabliſhe in all partes the trew worſhip of God, as our Sauiour Chriſt hath taught it, and commanded it to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. We ought to reioyce when any yeeld any maner of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Sauiour Chriſt, and ſhould we not much more reioyce to ſee any obedience in Princes? But when they bow ſo lowe before our Sauiour Chriſt, and doe that honor to him, as that at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, moſt notorious ſuperſtition &amp; ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie is publikely caſt out of their kingdomes and countreis, and the doctrine, neceſſarie to ſaluation, is authoriſed to bee preached &amp; publiſhed to their people. Exceeding great cauſe of comfort &amp; reioycing ought it to be to all the Church. Which is yet increaſed as their obedience and ſeruice ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and when the Church doeth ſee them bowe downe ſo lowe, to the Sonne of God, as to honour, ſerue and obey him in all things, which he hath commanded. For exceeding great increaſe is it of the honor of our Sauiour Chriſt, and therefore conſequentlie alſo of the comfort &amp; ioy of the Church, when the houſe &amp; kingdome of God is guyded by thoſe ordinances and lawes onely which the onely Lord thereof hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When no offices haue place in his Church, but ſuch as he hath ordayned, and when all ſuch are placed in it, as hee hath commaunded. When they are called to theſe charges by ſuch order as he hath preſcribed, and walke duetifullie in the ſame as aperteineth: the eſtabliſhing of theſe things in their due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in euery competent congregation of Gods people, and the obedience of all eſtates of the ſame, is ſo great a benefite, as he were worthie to ſorrowe, that ſhould not reioyce at ſo great bleſſings. Whiche being as in all other partes of the Lande, ſo more carefully obſerued in euery place, as it excelleth other: both for the honor of them whom God hath ſo exalted, and their good example amongſt the people, muſt needes be a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable ſpectacle to all the church. But yet a more heauenly ſight (all men muſt needes acknowledge it) to ſee the Royall houſe &amp; court of a ſoueraigne Prince, to haue ſuch order eſtabliſhed in it, that is the holy Goſpell of our Sauiour
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19103:117"/> Chriſt, vpon the Sabboth day, and other conuenient times in the weeke, to be ſoundly &amp; ſincerely preached in it by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters not charged with any other people, but appointed for the ſeruice of that chief part of the Church, and therefore alſo of greateſt graces of godly wiſedome, and faithfulnes, and euerie good and heauenly gifte meete for ſo precious a charge, the holy Sacramentes duely adminiſtred, the Lords watch careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet, for the preſeruation of the chiefe towre of Ieruſalem, his holy Treaſurie regarded, and all thoſe ſacred aſſemblies ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a godly reuerence.

Therefore in vayne &amp; to no good purpoſe, doeth the Replier aske whether this bleſſing be turned into a curſe, and whether we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude becauſe the golde is finer that is tryed ſeuen times in the fornace, and the perſecutions of the Church redounde in the ende both to the greater glorie of God, &amp; the better confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church. Whether I ſay for this cauſe wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in perſecution the church is more perfect in all hir regiment, and in moſt bleſſed eſtate: applying corruptly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto that place of the Apoſtle, <hi>becauſe where ſinne abounded, grace did more abounde, Shall we therefore abyde in ſinne, that grace may abounde?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.20. Rom. 6.1.</note> So if by an extraordinarie mercie of God, the church ſemed in ſome reſpects to be in moſt bleſſed eſtate in perſecution, ſhall wee ſay that perſecution is better for the Church then peace and proſperitie vnder a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate? The anſwere wherevnto is playne, that all other things being alike, and the difference of the Church ſtande onely in this, of being defended by a Chriſtian Prince, or perſecuted by an Enemie, it is to be eſteemed a ſpeciall and hye fauour of God to be ſo ſhielded and comforted, and fitter for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ordinarie courſe of gouerning the Church, then ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of trouble which are ſubiect to a thouſand inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But this nothing concerneth the Declaration, which only ſhewing by experience of former and preſent times that the regiment of the Church was, is, and may be moſt perfect euen where it wanteth the great comfort of the fauour of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Prince, argueth thereby the order which is followed in that treatiſe, to be lawful and good. So as if he would haue ſpoken to the poynt, that the declaration ſtandeth vpon, he had bene to ſhewe that the regiment of the Church neuer was, nor can be perfect, without a Chriſtian Magiſtrate. Which poynt hee would ſeeme alſo to growe nearer to, in that which followeth,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19103:118"/> wherein he laboureth to ſhewe the imperfection of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the primitiue Church by theſe reaſons. The regiment ſayeth he, was abuſed in thoſe that had giftes of tongues, of healing, &amp;c. Which is not ſo, for the abuſe of a thing proueth not t'him perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it. The light of the Sunne by day, of the Moone and ſtarres by night, yea all the creatures of God are abuſed: yet this proueth not the light of the Sunne to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, or the ſtate of other creatures in their originall creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at which time alſo they were abuſed. The word of God is abuſed diuerſlie,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.15.</note> ſome preaching it for contention, ſome for vayn glorie, ſome for couetouſnes to attayne to great worldly liuings and dignities, yet is the worde perfect,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.17.</note> as the Prophete ſayth in the Pſalme. So in the primitiue church,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.7.</note> the regiment and the order of it ſet downe, whereby it was to be gouerned, might be perfect, as it was in deede, notwithſtanding it were trewe, that ſome abuſed it, but that alſo is not ſhewed that the regiment is abuſed. For the abuſe of the ſpirituall giftes was a diſorder of particular perſons, &amp; not any imperfection in the regiment. Where by when the diſorder brake out, it was corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted &amp; redreſſed. The perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the regiment of the church can not make that offences and diſorders ſhould not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which thorowe the infirmitie and corruption of our nature will be, and hath bin at all times, but it may remedie and reforme them when they breake out. The ſame is to be ſayde of his next reaſon, that at that time there were falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Paſtours, Teachers, and Deacons, which being graunted argueth not the imperfection of the regiment of the Church at that time, but rather it being playne, that they who were ſuch, were by that regiment diſcouered and corrected as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayned, proueth the perfection of it. His third and laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is, that there were no ſuch gouernours in the primitiue Church to guyde it, as the declaration affirmeth there were, or els their authoritie extended not to correct ſo many fowle offences, as were in that time, or els they did not their duetie, or the people would not be ruled by them. Any of which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19103:119"/> poyntes being ſuch as might fall out, and yet the regiment perfect, as if his proofe reſted wholy vpon this, whether there were any ſuch Elders in the Church at that time or no, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all the other, and goeth about onely to proue that one poynt. Which, becauſe he doeth it moſt impertinentlie by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging 1. Corinth. the 6. Chapter, whiche ſerueth nothinge willinglie his purpoſe, but is drawen and haled to it by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And becauſe I doubt not, but if he thinke in deed there be any thing in that place for him, wee ſhall heare it agayne, and eſpeciallie becauſe he hath a whole booke after of that matter, I leaue it till we may come to it in order.</p>
            <p>In his diſcourſe vpon this place, beſides the chiefe purpoſe of handling it alreadie touched, he noteth that vnder Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, we are not bound to ſet vp priuate men to iudge our cauſes, as they were wiſhed, and herevpon gathereth that it were a daungerous thinge to followe the primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches regiment in ſo doing. Wherein, if there bee a ſparke of true light in him, he might perceyue that they were willed to doe ſo,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.1.</note> to auoyde pleading before infidells. Which cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, where God giueth his Church Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, it is playne, that ought to ceaſe with the cauſe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was no parte of the eccleſiaſticall regiment, that the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh of: yet he groweth from this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to a generall caution, of not making ordinarie rules of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examples, or commaundements of the Apoſtles, nor of our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.9.10</note> examplifying it by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes to the Diſciples, of not taking any thing with them in their iourney to preache, of abſteyning from Idoles, bloud, &amp; ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled (where I knowe not why he hath lefte out fornification, which is alſo mentioned with the reſt in that text) and of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bareheaded, as he tranſlateth it, 1. Corint. 11. But, ſayeth he, although there be no expreſſe mention, howe long theſe things ſhould continue yet leaueling theſe by the analogie of our faith and Chriſtian libertie we finde no neceſſitie of theſe or any other ſuch like orders, whereby he would implye the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19103:119"/> like of the regiment of the Churche then vſed, and leaue it nowe to our ſelues to deuiſe an order that may bee thought meete. Which reaſon if it were good, would ouerthrowe all Chriſtian Religion. For if it bee ſo as hee teacheth, what ſhall binde the church. If neyther examples, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, neither of our Sauiour Chriſt, nor of his Apoſtles ſhall binde vs, but he will ſaye, hee ſpeaketh of particular examples and rules: but I aunſwere he would applye this to generall &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall examples and commaundements ſuch as that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſet downe in the Declaration is grounded vpon, as hath bene ſhewed before. And for thoſe that are particular, he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth fayre, but commeth not neare the marke by a myle, for none of thoſe he mentioneth were contrarie as they were commaunded, either to the analogie of faith, or to Chriſtian libertie: for if they had, they could not haue bounde thoſe to whom they were giuen at that time. Therefore to hitte his marke, he muſt take another leuell, and conſider the reaſon of ſuch rules and commandements, which caryeth in it the light and the lyfe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes. For where that reaſon holdeth not, there are we free from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, but where the reaſon is in force, there are we no les bounde to the ſubſtance and effect of ſuch particular commandement then they were. So if there could be like reaſon as cauſed that com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement to the Diſciples, we were in ſuch caſe to keepe it, &amp; where the ſame offence is iuſtlie to be feared in eatinge of meates forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as was then &amp; may be in many like caſes now &amp; to the end, there that order of the Apoſtles bindeth. As for the laſt place out of the 1. Corinth. 11. if he looke better vpon it, hee ſhall finde that the Apoſtle groundeth that order there preſcribed vpon ſo generall and neceſſarie reaſons of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of GOD, the glorie of our Sauiour Chriſte, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of Angelles, and the voyce of nature, and the cuſtome of all the Churches, as hee hath taken his leuell farre amiſſe to leaue it at libertie, whether a man keepe it or no: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that hee vnderſtande the Apoſtles meaninge aright:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19103:120"/> which is, that men and women, eſpecially being preſent in the publike aſſemblies of the church ſhould carie the marke of their creation, agreeable to the ſexe whereof they were: the woman wearing vpon hir head a vayle or kerchief, or ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attyre, (according to the lawfull cuſtome of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and place of aboade) as declareth her ſexe and ſubiection to man by ſuch couerture of her head. And the man, by not wearing any ſuch attyre vppon his head, as is proper to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mankinde, but by wante of any ſuch vpon his head, hewe the glorie of Chriſt, and the honour that in the order of creation is beſtowed vpon men. Therefore notwithſtanding his cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or any thing here alleadged to the contrarie, it remayneth firme and ſtable, that the conſtant and perpetuall examples of the Churches, the orders, rules, and commaundements of our Sauiour Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, both for the poyntes of doctrine to be beleeued, and alſo for ſuch as are to bee obeyed and practiſed in the publique gouernement of the Church, and in the priuate lyfe of euery one, doe binde the conſcience of all the people of God to keepe and to obey them: yea the moſt particular rules, the like caſe and reaſon being in vs, that was in them to whom they were giuen. There followeth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle needles proofe, that Magiſtrates are neceſſarie, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowen ſufficientlie, and confeſſed of all, I proceede to that which followeth. That which followeth is a replie to the concluſion, which the Declaration gathereth of the former reaſon ſet downe in theſe wordes: <hi>By which it is manifest, that the regiment and gouernement thereof, dependeth not vppon the authoritie of Princes, but vpon the ordinaunce of God, who hath most mercifullie and wiſely ſo establiſhed the ſame, that as with the comfortable ayde of Christian Magistrates, it may ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie flouriſh and proſper, ſo without it, it may continue, and againſt the aduerſaries thereof preuayle. For the Church craueth helpe and defence of Christian Princes to continue, and goe forwarde more peaceably and profitably, to the ſetting vp of the kingdome of Christ: but all hir authoritie ſhe receyueth immediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:19103:120"/>
            <p>The Replyer can not or will not ſee that which is manifeſt, but denieth this conſequence to ſeeme ſo to him, and here his ſeas ryſe ſo hye, that, he ſayth, it is manifeſt violent conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yea a manifeſt iniurie both to God and his Church, and to all the authoritie of all Chriſtian Princes, and moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt wrong vnto her Maieſtie. If the lawe of God had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, that anie matter ſhould be helde certayne in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder two or three witneſſes: and if the teſtimonie of one man were inough to condemne another, it would haue gone hard. I ſee, with the authour of the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but ſeeing his worde is to carrie no more credit with it then he can bring ſufficient reaſon for it to make it good, let his reaſon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. His reaſon is, that it is inſinuated that hir Maieſtie, for clayming ſupreme authoritie in eccleſiaſticall cauſes clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth withall that the regiment of the Church dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hir authoritie. Which if any reaſonable man liuing, that is not a parciall fauourer, or fauourite, of the Hierarchie, can gather out of theſe wordes of the Declaration, I pleade for it no longer. But this (he ſayeth) is aggreeued in the oppoſition of Gods ordinance, to the authoritie of Princes, as if Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie were not the ordinance of God: addinge, that neyther Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes nor Anabaptiſtes could haue ſet downe a ſharper co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt th'authoritie of Princes then this is. Whiche are falſe alarums, and exclamations, or accuſations as vayne as the curſe that is cauſeles,<note place="margin">Prou. 26.2.</note> and therefore (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth) va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe away in the ayre. Which although it haue no proofe nor ſenſe it it, yet paſſing on to the next wordes of the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Which (he ſayeth) are added to ſmooth the former, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth another loude outcrie: <q rend="inline">This is another great iniurie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Chriſtian Princes, who by theſe wordes are thruſt not onely out of all authoritie in the Church, but eyther out of the Church altogither as no part of it at all, or at leaſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions part, ſtriuing in the Church for authoritie. </q>
            </p>
            <p>His proofe is this: <q rend="inline">For what els meane they by theſe words, <hi>The Church craueth helpe and defence of Christian Princes, but</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:19103:121"/> that they ſeparate the Chriſtian Prince, and the Church.</q> If the honourable ſworde of iuſtice committed to ſoueraigne Princes, for protecting the good ſubiect, and puniſhinge the euill, were at the commaundement of ſuch Chapleynes, as this Replyer is, I ſee by his often accuſations of ſlaundering, and iniuring the Prince, without all cauſe or colour, it would leeſe the honour it ought to haue, being made a weapon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice. In the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if a man had charged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with any crime,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.19.</note> if he made not good proofe of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as he would haue done to another by his falſe witneſſe, ſo was it to be done to him, whether it were a matter of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or of lyfe. If the Replyer feared to bee dealte with accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule, he would not bee ſo readie, to laye ſo great crymes to any mans charge vppon no reaſon. But becauſe informers may bee hearde, they ſaye, for the Prince, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come to queſtion, although the accuſation be neuer ſo vniuſt, it ſeemeth hee emboldeneth him ſelfe vppon ſome ſuch like aſſurance.</p>
            <p>By this occaſion hee inquireth who ſhould bee meant by the Church, whether the people, (whiche hee thinketh can not) or the foure Tetrarkes, as hee calleth them in his ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſpeache, and this hee taketh, and compareth them with popiſhe prieſtes, who hee ſayeth, gaue the ſame power and authoritie vnto Chriſtian Princes, that is giuen heere, and with better tearmes. Wherein if hee looke backe to former tymes, or conſider well what the papiſtes eſteeme of the othe of the Supremacie, and what is done in kingdomes ſubiect to the Biſhop of Roome, and compare it with that which the Declaration, and all they in whoſe behalfe it was publiſhed, doe moſt willinglie acknowledge by proteſtation, and alſo by othe, to bee the moſte due honour of the Soueraigne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: hee ſhall eaſelie ſee, howe vniuſt this charge is, as well as are his other. There was a purpoſe, I thinke, hee will ſaye, when the ſtatute for recognition of hir Maieſties Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraingtie was made, to agniſe to the vttermoſt by that othe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19103:121"/> all the Regalities, rightes and honours due to that high and ſoueraigne eſtate. Whiche if it were attayned vnto, howe can hee charge anie with derogation from the Princes right, and iuſt authoritie, that taketh willinglie that othe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the authoritie there agnized, euen as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by hir Maieſties owne iniunctions, by the Articles of the conuocation houſe, and ſundrie bookes publiſhed with great allowance of the ſtate. But to this poynt there is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie ſayde before, both in this treatiſe, and in the anſwere to the preface of his replie.</p>
            <p>He cauilleth here about that the Declaration ſayeth, <hi>All the authoritie which the Church hath, is immediatlie of God,</hi> and mooueth manie friuoulous queſtions about it. But if hee had diſallowed it, he ſhould haue entred into the handling of it, and ſhewed by ſufficient proofe of holy Scripture, that the Church holdeth not all hir authoritie immediatly of God, but holdeth ſome part of it, mediatlie of Princes, as meane Lordes vnder the higheſt. Some offer hee maketh of it, alleadginge the authoritie of the godlie and vertuous Kings and Rulers of <hi>Jſraell and Iuda,</hi> which if it be all that he can ſay in that cauſe, let him vnderſtande, that as it hath bin in this cauſe profeſſed on our behalfe by ſome other, ſo nowe agayne we truely and vnfaynedly profeſſe to acknowledge in Chriſtian Princes, all that power and authoritie that the Prophetes doe any where iuſtifie to haue bin in the Rulers of Gods people at any time.</p>
            <p>I adde yet further, that whereas he pretendinge to ſpeake moſt largelie of this authoritie, ſayeth: <hi>Princes haue not the eccleſiasticall Ministers peculiar offices and eccleſiasticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to execute the actes, proper to their eccleſiasticall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but haue authoritie to ouerſee, gouerne and direct all eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall perſons to doe their dueties in all eccleſiasticall cauſes, and haue the highest authoritie (that is ciuill) in the Church, for the orderinge, dispoſinge, and authorizinge anie order or constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eccleſiasticall in indifferent matters:</hi>
